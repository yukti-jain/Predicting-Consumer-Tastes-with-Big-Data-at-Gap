# Predicting Consumer Tastes with Big Data at Gap
Peck's decision to eliminate the position of Creative Director was incorrect. Despite his shift towards big data predictive modeling, it did not yield the improvements he desired. To examine the effects of Peck's decision on the Gap, Old Navy, and Banana Republic brands, we will analyze some of the publicly available data on the web. Specifically, we will examine Gap brand portfolio 10-K's, Google Trend data, and perform sentiment analysis on Gap reviews.
