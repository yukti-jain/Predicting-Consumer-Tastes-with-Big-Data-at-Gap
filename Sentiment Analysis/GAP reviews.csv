1,Account disappeared.,Had an account for over 10 years. And now it has simply disappeared. The new website is asking me to re-register. All I wanted was my order history.Customer services have no record of me ever having an account. Absolute rubbish.
1,Ordered two pairs of trousers and they‚Ä¶,"Ordered two pairs of trousers and they sent a completely different item to the one I ordered. Emailed them immediately asking to rectify the error, received confirmation then nothing. Finally an email saying they were closing the query as I did not respond. To what??? Very poor."
1,Gone downhill,This was my favourite brand with hoodies and jeans fitting the best. I was ordering from GAP for 10 years or more and always knew that everything will fit and is as described. Over last year it has gone downhill. Last two times I ordered jeans they didn't fit well and also were not anything like in the picture. The description of the item - material composition was not provided too. This is the last time I ordered jeans from GAP
3,Seems very different now,"I used to buy a lot of basics from GAP, especially in the summer, but it seems very different now. The website looks just like the Next website. I don't know if it's just my imagination but the clothes look very similar too now... all very samey. There's very little product information and the photos aren't very good... sometimes there's just one photo, even just a sideways one of an arm or something. I landed up returning most of my order as it wasn't what I was expecting... very short items, almost cropped, not in the description... that kind of thing.On the plus side, the delivery was quick, as was the return and refund, although they deducted for postage.Overall, I can't imagine ordering from GAP again, which is a shame really.The other day I got an email from Joules to say Next would be managing their website and other services from now on, but not taking over exactly I don't think. I hope that doesn't go the same way."
1,AVOID - Beyond Shambolic,AVOID - Beyond Shambolic!Placed two orders to two different stores as I've gone away. Sent wrong sizes out and delivered to stores I've never been to or even listed as a delivery option. An absolute clowns outfit & not fit for purpose. The delivery company you use ‚ÄòEvri' are also grossly negligent.
5,Fabric Fabric Fabric!,"Most of the items sold in GAP have amazing natural fabric! Also, the accessible price is very attractive. All of GAP's competitors like MANGO, Zara, e.t.c have awful fabrics - cheap and synthetic. Even the higher end brands like REISS and GUESS use awful fabric for their products. Please, never change!"
1,Hopeless website,"I used to order clothes from website frequently, but now it's impossible to order anything.Couldn't sign in.  Tried password reset many times without success.  Contacted customer support, who said password reset didn't work (seriously!?)  They offered to remove my account so I could create a new one.   I took the offer.   But now can't sign in nor register!  And awful website forces one to have an account to order.I have the basket ready to order, but can't.  Guess I need to take my money elsewhere."
4,Good website and offers,"Good website and offers. Haven't returned anything in over a year so not sure about returns. However, I wish there would always be stock of the basics like the modern crew neck and v-neck tees in petite sizing (i am not that petite but norMal ones are very long). Gap is where I go for these essential basics for the entire family. Please please keep these well stocked they are better than my much more expensive tees which I will only keep until you restock. Kids clothings is also fabulous."
1,Terrible customer service experienced,"Oh my goodness I can't even begin to explain!! I used to absolutely love GAP. One of my favourite go to stores, I can't even think how much money I've spent with them over the decades. However, my recent experience of them is utterly flabbergasting - sorry for sounding OTT but wow, the worst experience in terms of not receiving items with no explanation, then reordering and only some turning up. Then being told that some items that are in the sale can take up to 42 days to ship. Yes, you read that right, 42 days!!! Inconsistent information given via their correspondence but overall terrible experience. There goes another great brand üò¢üò¢"
1,AVOID AVOID!! DO NOT REFUND YOUR MONEY AND HOLD ONTO IT IN THEIR BANK,"GAP did a 'stop and return' item on my parcel. I have never received it in the 1st place. I am then told that they will not refund me until their courier has 1st returned it to their warehouse and then to GAP warehouse where it will take a further 5 working days to process. I had the money taken out of my account when I purchased my item, waited until delivery which did not happen and they did a 'stop and return' followed by me having to wait a further 10 WORKING DAYS  for a refund. This is a US company that normally EXCEL at customer experience but this is shocking. They just want to hold onto my money! AVOID!!!"
2,They use yodel as their courier,They use yodel as their courier. Yodel lie about attempted deliveries and say they have left a card. This has happened twice now. Customer service quick to reply but offer no real solution. I'm still trying to get my stuff 7 days after an apparent delivery attempt. Yodel are renowned for this. Stop using them gap!!!!!
5,As I have been working from home for‚Ä¶,"As I have been working from home for some time now, I was looking for trousers that look smart while being as comfortable as slackers are. My partner suggested Gap, and the products were exactly what I was looking for. While placing an order, I forgot to add a discount code. After contacting customer service, the code was swiftly added, before my card was charged. Overall a pleasant experience."
1,Very Bad quality,"Bought 2 cami tops in Gran Canaria GAP Store for 30‚Ç¨ each, after first wash you can throw it in the bin, pilling all over them! Was expecting better quality for the price I got them!"
1,Absolutely useless,"Absolutely useless. Online order form constantly tells you to enter a valid postcode, even though the postcode you use has worked on every other website on the planet, except this one. How convenient that this is happening when everything is 50%off. Don't bother wasting your time. Shop elsewhere to avoid certain disappointment."
1,TERRIBLE customer support i would‚Ä¶,TERRIBLE customer support i would rather not even leave 1 star - 0 would be more appropriate. Worst customer service i have come across. Avoid spending your money at Gap !
1,Terrible customer support.,"Terrible customer support.I razed a complain as I received items not matching my order. In few days I got response ‚Äúas we have not heard anything more from you, we consider this to be resolved‚Äù. But I have never heard anything back on my initial query and complain. Very disappointing and even if I liked anything from their store, their arrogance will make me to buy nothing."
5,Good experience only so far,"I was really worried as I checked trustpilot after purchasing online from Gap. But I have had 4 separate orders from them so far and no problems. Quality is great. Delivery process was quick - they only send confirmation and despatch emails but there was never an email telling me that it was out for delivery, but it always gets here within the week. Got my refunds within 2 weeks of Gap receiving my return."
1,YOUR RIGHT GAP IS CRAP,"YOUR RIGHT GAP IS CRAP! Been buying my sons clothes from gap for years, not anymore! Placed online order, got email saying order didn't go through so re done order. Got the order, turns out was charged twice unknowingly missing items, American call center clueless unwilling to help always saying call back later!! No refund for missing items! Thanks gap and goodbye! Buy British!"
4,Surprisingly quick,"Worried about ordering from Gap after reading some of the reviews but I decided to test it on something cheap because I miss the shop and need summer clothes. Chose standard delivery on Friday night, item came today (Monday). No need to pay extra for next day delivery because this was speedy enough. Have now placed another order. The only problem is the tshirt I ordered was slightly different to the picture, but no big deal - still looks fine. Also sometimes the sizing can be inconsistent in Gap so there's certain things I won't be ordering until I can get to a Gap store to return things. Otherwise, all good."
1,What did Next do to Gap,"What did Next do to Gap! seriously I always placed large orders for my family, my young son loves their clothes,  I loved their Jeans but  no short leg anymore and a handful to choose from. I always loved an offer which gap always ran sadly no more. This is so so disappointing as I was actually excited that Next were taking it on so I could have collect from store, well I won't be collecting anything anymore. Ruined a great website."
5,I could not recommend GAP enough,I could not recommend GAP enough. I don't have much experience online but customer service in shops is brilliant. Staff cannot help you enough. I have been shopping there for years now and they delivered every time. Good value for money specialy arround sales üòä Thank you üòä Shop we always look forward to!
5,Great online service ‚Ä¶,"I love the gap clothes for children it's long lasting,washes great and my kids actually want to wear them !!! This is the first time I've done an online order since the shops shut but I was so impressed. Ordered Monday (Bank holiday) and it was delivered Friday morning. You recieve a return label if you need to return. Still the same great quality and quick delivery!!!"
3,Teething troubles or badly run?,"Teething troubles or badly run? This has not been a good experience of the new online Gap.I was sent a tracking number that is not recognised by the system. Tried the online chat: not working at this time. Not working in the middle of the afternoon. Just tried phoning: ""due to an ongoing emergency (we don't actually employ people - maybe?) we are unable to take your call,  goodbye"".Sent an email. Nothing in response.After posting a more critical version of this review I received an email with a new tracking number that did lead to Hermes (if this is the preferred courier of Gap it suggests they're running the business on a shoe string - Hermes are more likely to be cheap than reliable). Hope in future they give a courier option..."
5,Fast delivery and high quality,Made different online orders at Gap.co.uk and I can definitely say that they were the fastest deliveries ever! Ordered Sunday night and received Tuesday morning.The quality of the clothes is very high. Returned some items for wrong size and receveid the refund in few days
5,Brilliant service,"I placed an on-line order with Gap before reading the reviews on Trustpilot.  I must admit I was worried by the bad reports. Fortunately my experience of their service was excellent.  I placed my order on Monday 25th July, I received my order on Wednesday 27th July, I returned the unwanted items on Thursday 28th July, I had an email confirming that GAP had received my returns on Tuesday 2nd Aug and the refund was in my account today 4th Aug.  Brilliant service (or perhaps I was just lucky) anyway really pleased."
5,New GAP in Manchester arndale centre,"The new GAP store in Manchester Arndale centre is fabulous and it's being run really well by the manager Sarah, who is very active and helpful on the shop floor and even introduced herself when I spoke to her upon arrival as I'd already spoken to her on the telephone when she put the items I wanted to one side.  Also Iymaan on the tills was an absolute delight and the perfect personality for that role, making sure everyone was happy. All in all, there seems to be a great team of women there."
1,Wrong Size item sent out twice.,Ordered on line as no stores close by. The wrong size item was sent out twice. Once is forgivable but not twice.  I won't use them again. It's a shame as I ordered based on a previous purchase.
1,"Order still ""pending"" after 5 days","Order still ""pending"" after 5 days, customer service offer nothing but apologise , well apologise doth butter no parsnips ! I expected far better service from a global brand as GAP, Terrible service. Will also give feedback on Trustpilot . If you took as much time on fulfilling orders as you do on sending daily spam advertising then maybe you would get your orders out on time and in the timescale promised ! little wonder why if this is their level of standards and customer care why all their UK stores were closed !"
1,I bought online items and got delivered‚Ä¶,"I bought online items and got delivered to Ireland. But I could not return them. Gap stores in blanchardstown refused to refund. Online options were as follows.1. Royal mail... AnPost didn't accept it.2. Collect+ ... no collect plus in Ireland. And their so called partners ""PARCELMOTEL"" had no such option when I made an account.3. I contacted customer service but they could not help. bunch of stupid people I encountered today. Such a bad experience for buying on GAP sebsite"
2,Jeans aren't as advertised,"I ordered some jeans that were advertised as being stretch jeans. When they arrived, they were not stretchy at all.  I returned them and ordered a different pair... then they arrived and yet again they weren't stretchy, so had to return them too. Customer service said they would change the wording on the website  but they still haven't done so. Have given 2 stars rather than 1 as at least customer service replied in good time.Very few sizes available on website."
1,Absolute garbage,"Absolute garbage. I used to shop at gap all the time, they had trendy styles which were good quality at affordable prices.I think next have taken over to run it in the ground.Terrible styles, terrible customer service all at a higher price.Thry wont be seeing another penny from me."
1,They lost my order.,They lost my order..  didnt email me so I had to track down the items I'd paid for and never recieved. To add insult as an apology they offered me the promo code that they offer all customers on the website. When I pointed this out they apologised that I wasnt satisfied with my experience... really poor customer service. Theres too many brands now with equal products and much better customer service for Gap to treat their loyal customers so poorly.
1,Gap should be called Crap,"Ordered a birthday present online, the day of delivery (less than an hour before delivery) I get an email to say that part of the order isn't included, and with absolutely no chance f being able to get something else in time. Off course Crap had no problem in taking the money off me straight away if only their customer service team could operate as quickly as the collections team.DON'T ORDER FROM GAP!!!!!!#GapAreCrap"
1,delivery dates are all lies,"checked on my order as it seemed to be taking longer than it should. Customer Services told me it would be 10 business days and it had not been despatched as yet. My email confirmation clearly stated 4-7 business days, but they said it was the holidays and the order could not be amended.Happy enough to take your money for an expedited delivery, but won't honour the contract when it comes to standard delivery.Be wary if you are ordering for xmas as the delivery dates advertised are all lies."
1,To continue from yesterday,"To continue from yesterday, so glass came in for window only to be wrong again, it really is so hard for them to get an order correct.Took our installer so long just to get this far, GAP Plastics are a pathetic excuse for a company.Come on GAP make this right, show that if you really make an effort you can deliver right on the goods ordered."
1,Do not,"Do not, do not, do not buy a merino jumper from gap unless you want to buy incredibly expensive loo roll. Gap's jumpers literally could not be thinner or more transparent if they were spun by imprisoned elves out of gossamer. What a rip-off."
1,New website is absolutely terrible‚Ä¶,New website is absolutely terrible since it launched a few days ago.  Literally cannot order anything on there.  It also said that discounts are just as good as before but that's a lie.  There are no extra 50% off sale price prices and there are no additional 10-30% discount  of sale prices either.  The old model worked so well and I could pick up brilliant bargains for around ¬£1-2.  Now the minimum price you'll find is ¬£4.  Being back the old gap!!
1,Shockingly poor service,"Spent over the threshold for free delivery, yet I was nonetheless charged for delivery. Separately, I went to store on my birthday to claim 50% birthday discount. Store assistant said the discount would not go through as the app hadn't sent me a message code(?) despite the fact I'd registered months ago with all my correct details. Contacted Gap via phone, email & letter, but have received no contact whatsoever and it's now 5 months later.Would not expect this from an expensive, well-established brand like GAP.Very disappointed."
1,What a pointless company,What a pointless company. The website is still as useless as it ever was and the stock levels are a joke. Anyway managed to find three things to buy. Got a message saying delivery was attempted. This was a lie I was sat next to the door at the time they allegedly visited.To avoid this happening again I arranged for the supposed re-deliveryTo go to a locker. A week later still no update on delivery process. You can't contact their abysmal courier. A complete waste of time and effort.
5,EXCELLENT SERVICE,"I'm afraid I have to disagree, with some of the other comments.  I placed an order for my granddaughters birthday‚Ä¶ arrived on time but unfortunately was a bit tight on her hips. I returned it within  a few days of receipt and received an email from Gap 29/9 to acknowledge receipt of my return. The funds were back in my account 30/9‚Ä¶."
1,Forced to buy online due to stores‚Ä¶,"Forced to buy online due to stores closures, had to return products and being told might have to wait 30 days for a refund - of course they feel that quoting the Coronavirus etc etc makes this acceptable. Why then doesn't it state this on their website! In the current climate you need to be encouraging people to spend money with you gap not treating your customers badly."
1,"Didn't deliver, didn't care","Spent hours selecting ¬£200 of clothes. Got a dispatch notification. Never received any clothes. Next I hear of it, I get a refund notification. Speak to live chat, get told ü§∑ courier couldn't deliver. What a load of rubbish - I live in the middle of the city. They seriously think I'm going to order again, no chance. What a waste of my time."
2,How to make things very complicated! Terrible refund policy,"How to make things very complicated! One order with 3 items. Shipped separate by 2 different couriers (1 Hermes & 1 Yodel) original full charge refunded and charged separate for each delivery, refunded again and charged again. Upon return easy enough to take to the post office but now waiting for a refund and told have to wait up to 2 billing cycles - that can be over 2 months from when they get it back. All in all they had my money for about 7 weeks and still awaiting a refund. There should be a time limit imposed on companies like this for a 5 day window to send the money back - not over 60 days! Very poor and won't be ordering online again - Mind the gap!"
1,I agree totally with the previous‚Ä¶,I agree totally with the previous reviewer.    MUCH more expensive.   Less bargains.   Less choice.    What a disappointment and a missed opportunity as I was looking forward to see what it would bring.   All the physical shops closed.   The sister brand Banana Republic also axed.  Will be very surprised if Gap are still trading in a years time in the UK.  It used to be quite an iconic brand.   I loved the quality of the shirts and chinos etc.   Very sad.
1,Gap's poor website and new styling,"When Next took over Gap's website, I knew that would be the last I purchased from Gap despite being a huge buyer of gap clothes for my two boys before. I find their website to be identical to the Next one, which I already hated but I also find their new clothing styling to be as bland as Next's. It's a big no from me unfortunately and I will no longer buy product from Gap"
5,I Can't Fault Them,"I have ordered from Gap a lot over the past couple of years and have never had a problem. I am always impressed by the quality of their clothes. I buy for my children and grandchildren and the clothes are lovely, especially the childrens. The last order I placed recently was for a winter coat for my daughter. The delivery time given was as over a week as I picked the cheapest option. You can imagine how pleased I was when Hermes delivered the next day!"
1,Ignored emails. Stolen product.,"Sent a faulty item back in July/August. Customer Services were very helpful and promised me a gift voucher in return. THREE months later, countless emails sent chasing and no vouchers or response to my emails! They have basically stolen my product! DISGUSTING."
2,Website not functional,"Tried to order an item, couldn't get through to completed order page. Customer chat very polite but couldn't help with order. Now the order has gone through four times and they are attempting to cancel. Website doesn't seem to function properly and now I may have paid out four times."
1,Violently slow refund times,"Purchased a pair of shorts, took all the tags off, only go realise that there was a gaping hole in the pocket area where the stitching had seemingly been missed! Sent pictures in to customer service and was asked to return the item. Took several weeks to receive a reply, where I was told that the item did not meet GAPs 'return policy guidelines' but they would process a refund out of 'courtesy'. However, I am told that I will have to wait 1-2 billing cycles to receive this refund! Absolute shambles. For a big company, you'd expect so much better."
1,Crap Gap,"The company I work for use gap groups daily/weekly without fail. The equipment is NEVER delivered on time, always excuse of driver knock or wagon problems. Equipment is substandard so I would Advise anyone that hires to give tools a real good check or you could be charged for damages."
1,What is it about GAP and sizing....,"Review by my wife....What is it about GAP and sizing..? Buying from their shops is bad enough, with US and European sizing and no UK equivalent. Now having made the mistake of buying some dungarees online because UK sizing is actually given I find that a size 8 is actually about a size 12 and a size 10 would fit my husband (they don't suit him though)! Correct and consistent sizing should be a 'no brainer', their crazy system must be costing them a fortune in return postage and extra work.I now have to hope I can get a refund, looking at other comments here it seems there might be more hassle to come!AVOID...."
5,"GAP at the Trafford Centre, place to shop for excellent customer care.","GAP at the Trafford Centre was great! The lady on the shop floor - Alison, went above and beyond helping my daughter choose the right jeans. Even when the sale was nearly completed, she went out of her way to tell us about the app and the amazing saving - thank you so much, you not only did your job - you excelled and did it all with a smile!"
1,"My first order, I shale not bother again.","My first order and I received from the neighbour‚Ä¶ The address printed on the parcel delivered by Yodel was so small and unclear, they had delivered to the wrong address. I ordered a boys dressing gown which was really poor quality. Shocking considering the price on top of delivery! I usually order from M&S but they were out of stock,The Next store should have been my next choice of place to shop."
5,Very happy.,"I purchased 7 pairs of jeans, 3 sweatshirts and a jacket, and they all were top notch. The delivery took 4 days, in which the dispatch process took 3 (the delivery way 24 hours). I disliked only one pair of jeans and decided to send them back. They included prepaid postage (Royal Mail 48 and Yodel) stickers in the parcel, which surprised me. I just packed the jeans, put on the sticker and sent it back. I did not need to message them or call. The instructions of return were clear. Put the item, put the sticker on the parcel and send it back. I received a refund after just 7 days. Very, very pleased with them. I don't understand how people could have such negative experience."
1,No customer service available,"Placed an order though their website. Order got lost in the Evri system (as usual). 5 e-mails later and 5 cals to the useless CS number which cutts off whichever option you choose there was no way to get in touch with them. Finally posted an ugly comment on their FB page which finally made them get back to me, only to be given a US number on which to re-order my lost items. Complete BS of a company and customer service. Never again will I use their service!"
1,Gap's mens sizes are guess work!,"Dear all....enjoy trying to navigate Gap size guides which seem only to exist for women's clothing! Irrespective of how you try to access a size guide for men's clothing, it does not work! Shame and dk how you expect to sell clothes online if you cannot assess the correct size! Thought Gap was an iconic brand of quality...must not be that keen to sell."
1,It gets worse and worse,"If this is what life is going to be with online buying then god help us.It really look like these retailers ran out of revenue during the pandemic and now are trying to, distortantly and dishonestly, get it back. You place your order, pay for it and then never receive it. When you query it your given the most stupid excuse that these retailers are now monotonously using with every single customer. You then get offered a refund which you may have to wait for months to get back if you luck. If this is not a way of illegally generating money, I don't know what to call it."
1,Incompetent,"As others have said gap is crap. Cancelled two orders for no reason, and have yet to refund me.. This happened in October yet 8 weeks later i still do not have my money, constant emails and promises of 7 working days, followed by phone calls to ignorant Yank customer services I am going to have to go through the fraud route with the credit card company because they keep saying its sorted and it isn't! Like dealing with a bunch of customer service reps with severe disabilities. Leave Gap in the 90s because not only will they not deliver they will also keep your money."
1,2 MONTHS FOR A REFUND!,"They received 2 returns from me on the 10/05, only got a confirmation of receipt today for 1?The email confirmation also states the following:If you paid with a credit card, your credit should appear on your statement in one to two billing cycles.Really awful and unacceptable."
1,Extremely disappointing,Extremely disappointing. It's 6 weeks and I am still waiting to receive delivery ! for items I bought on Gap.eu website. Costumer service is useless. Despite ongoing global situation other online e-stores still manage to provide a good and timely delivery service. In the future I will consider other options on the market for my e-shoppping . I do not recommend Gap.
5,I never ever have problem with Gap,"I never ever have problem with Gap. Smooth delivery, no faults or incorrect items. Easily can get help from customer service if needed. Always quick refund if I have to return. Even during the lockdown they were efficient and professional. Highly recommended."
1,Do not buy on line from this company,"I recently bought a hoody for my grandsons birthday which is 14 May.  I ordered it on 26th April and it took a few days to arrive.  It was given to him yesterday and found to be far too big. I phoned to arrange a return and exchange.  I was told it was outside the Gap 14 days return policy so no refund or exchange  could be made, however, they were happy to place an order for a smaller size.  I pointed out that it took a few days to arrive but that cut no ice.  I will never shop at Gap again and advise everyone else to consider buying from an honest and fair supplier for their requirements"
5,I nearly didn't ordered from Gap,"I nearly didn't ordered from Gap after reading the reviews on here but there were a few things I wanted to buy, so took the plunge. I ordered 10 items in all with standard delivery, 6 arrived the next day and the remaining 4 on the following day. The only glitch was a pair of jeans were delivered instead of a jumper. I needed a longer length in most items, so 8 items were returned. I have received the refund for both parts of the order in less than 2 weeks after I returned them with Royal Mail. Excellent service and the next order (longer lengths) arrived the next day as well."
2,Waited almost 9 weeks for a refund.,"Sent for a pair of jeans online which didn't fit, so returned them via Royal Mail the next day. Tracking confirms that Gap received my return on 20th March. Having not received my refund 6 weeks later, I called customer services who confirmed receipt but said that refunds often take at least 6 weeks! I had still not received the refund a further 2 weeks later, so called again. This time I was told I would receive an immediate refund but when I asked why it had taken so long, the Customer Service Assistant declined to answer.  I eventually received my refund a week later.  How can they justify keeping my money for so long? Don't buy online from Gap unless you can navigate their strange sizing or can afford for them to keep your money for months and only return it if you chase them up!"
1,Terrible service,"Terrible service, parcel never arrived.Courier said he tried to drop it off, but I was on all day. I never received a calling card. I arranged another day off of work, stayed in that day and apparently it never even left the depot on that day. Gap neither apologised, just offered a refund after I got yodel to send it back. I wouldn't buy from gap again, just not worth the hassle."
5,excellent,I was a bit worried about the poor reviews‚Ä¶ but I triedmy first order‚Ä¶ two items just wanted to see what to expect‚Ä¶ got free delivery (you get it when you sped over ¬£25) and it came within 3 days‚Ä¶ the quality of the clothes for the money was excellent so I ordered moresecond order placed 20/4 8pm much more items‚Ä¶ free delivery again and it was delivered 23/4 in the morning‚Ä¶ no problems at allPS. the t-shirts are fantastic!!!
1,Sad news for Gap joining the Next platform,"Sad news for Gap. It went the same way as Reiss did when it joined the bottom by becoming part of the Next platform. The new Gap website is absolutely hopeless compared to what it was before Next got involved. It looks like a bucket shop website, most of the items are no longer there - not even if you search for the well-known names such as Gap Body. Shame but at least it means one less place to shop so hopefully save more money. Bye bye Gap, sorry Next."
5,Great job Gap online team,"Great job Gap online teamI am a simple customer whose view won't be heard but its worth to thank the online Gap team for the excellent quality of the products, excellent service, excellent delivery. I had my order delivered today and i feel more than happy."
1,Terrible experience,They use Yodel as they delivery service so parcel never delivered. No help from GAP customer service. They did not even feel like doing anything about the issue so basically I lost time dealing with customer services and money for the item I never received. Feel cheated.
1,Rude staff‚Ä¶,I went to collect my parcel from Stratford  Westfield store. The lady at reception was rude. I gave her my order number but she said she need barcode. I did not receive any barcode so I had to cancel the order. Very disappointed. Never shop from gap
1,What's going on GAP?!,"We have bought many items from GAP - both instore and online.  Recently I placed an order for some jeans for my daughter - and that's the last we've heard from GAP.  There has been no communication about the order, shipment etc. and when I checked online my order has been cancelled.  I've since been trying to reach GAP by email and phone - you've guessed it, no luck at all.  For every option on the phoneline, I just get cut off.  What's going on GAP?!  So disappointing that your stores have closed, but equally that your customer service is no non-existent..."
5,First class,Use Gap on line regularlyExcellent quality and some real bargains on sale siteFast efficient delivery and very easy returnsCan't praise highly enough
5,I've been GAP client for the last 25‚Ä¶,"I've been GAP client for the last 25 years. I just love their stuff though I do find that full price it's expensive, maybe a bit too expensive. I've been shopping there for baby and kid clothes for all my nephews and nieces, any excuse to go to kids department really:) I read that they are closing down in Europe soon and that's a shame. I'll miss my stuff."
5,Excellent service,"Purchased online due to shops being closed for Virus. I opted for the free delivery and it arrived less than 24 hours later. I had expected it to take a few days, so was very pleased. My order was exactly as described and it fit perfectly. I like GAP because the sizes are true."
1,Gaps website is terrible why are the no‚Ä¶,Gaps website is terrible why are the no sizes available in chinos. I don't buy anything from there anymore the quality is terrible. Gant for mid to high price are better quality or sometimes I just go to h&m
1,Joke for online company,"delivery takes 10 working days in age of next day amazon prime. No email on shipment or delivery. Returns post delivery to their warehouse takes 15 days for refund. Joke, seriously avoid."
1,Gap UK is just depressing now,"I used to love the Gap - always a sure bet if I needed jeans, a jacket, belt, knickers, bra, pjs, jumper, workout gear, etc. Prices were good and the deals that showed up in my email made it better. I enjoyed 'window shopping' the website and usually bought whenever they had a sale. As things wound down with the move to Next, no sizes were ever available, and the items that I loved disappeared - colourful knickers, soft bras, belts, bags, fun shoes, socks, never to be seen again. The new website is, quite frankly, depressing. Completely joyless and super cheap-looking with a thumbnail that can be enlarged to a postage stamp with one strangely-posed view of the item. Still hardly any sizes available and everything looks so cheap, like total sweatshop. Delivery and returns are way too much trouble now with closure of all the shops. Other than one pair of joggers that run very short (that I kept due to impossibility of returns), I've not bought anything in ages and am unsubscribing from their emails.  I don't even want to hear from them. Too depressing."
1,Gap sent a product I haven't ordered‚Ä¶,Gap sent a product I haven't ordered instead of the product I ordered and paid for. I tried calling but the customer service line isn't working. Every option you press just disconnects the call! I tried emailing and 5 days later still no response! When I chased it they told me send the wrong product through their returns and order the product again! Absolute joke! Never ordering from Gap again!!!!
1,100-Day Refunds: Beware,"Ordered 2 identical pairs of jeans. Swift delivery but the warehouse sent 2 completely different pairs of jeans. Phoned up to ask for a replacement for the mistake GAP made. Was told I needed to pay to have another pair sent out and I would then send the other pair back and wait a refund which can take anything up to 100 days. Refund arrived THREE WEEKS after sending back jeans due to the warehouse packing the incorrect items. In 2018, this is frankly appalling and seems to purely so GAP can hold on to your money longer and make interest on it."
1,"Very slow delivery service, I expected much better from GAP. Order cancelled without my consent.","Very slow delivery service, the order was placed 3 days ago and I'm still awaiting despatch of the items. Delivery is estimated between 3 and 5 working days. Considering today is the 3rd working day and it still hasn't been despatched, I'll be very surprised if it arrived within the 5 working days advertised. I expected a great deal better from such a well known brand as GAP. Very very disappointed customerUpdate - I've had no follow up from the review and having checked the order status today, it has been cancelled without my consent. Having questioned this previously with GAP (as I was clearly able to see the items were out of stock), I was assured that I would receive my order by the 5 working days) - how do I make a formal complaint against GAP!!??"
5,Excellent Customer Service!,"I'm so impressed with GAP UK. During the busy Christmas / Lockdown period, I made an error and returned some items from a different company to the Gap Returns address. I contacted customer services and they assured me they would put a note on my order and when the returns team got to my parcel they would return it. I really didn't think I'd get the items back. It was such a busy period and I just accepted to lose out on about ¬£100. Then a couple of weeks later I received all the lost items, all newly packaged and delivered back to me.I was so happy and grateful for them to return the items. Such great customer service! I would highly recommend this company."
1,Refusing to refund as legally required,"I returned my order on 16/05 and they received it back in their warehouse on 18/05. After a week of waiting patiently and no contact/refund, I contacted them to ask where my refund is. They told me I have to wait until 7 June (3 weeks!) before chasing my refund, which is not only unreasonable but unlawful. I pointed out that retailers legally have 14 days from the date it was received back to process a refund to the customer. The customer service agent refused to discuss the matter further and terminated our chat.I certainly won't be buying again - Not only was the attitude of the service agent disgusting, but the clothes are appalling quality too.EDIT: I've now filed a chargeback - Enjoy!"
1,Rubbish customer service,"I bought a number of items online on Sunday, and only noticed several hours later that although the billing address was correct, the system had picked up an old address for delivery. I therefore emailed customer services at 7.21am - before processing had even started, and also kept phoning until I was able to speak to someone. But despite having been told that Hermes would be given the correct address, the parcel has been delivered to the wrong address, and was supposedly signed for by the household. I appreciate that I probably should have spotted the error before pressing the order button, but it's ridiculous that the error couldn't be put right. Not the first time I have had problems with Gap / Hermes. Won't be buying from Gap again."
5,Very happy to shop with Gap,"Very happy to shop with Gap! Excellent quality,  fast delivery and easy returns! I always buy clothes for my son, he is allergic to many materials, but Gap quality is very good for his skin! Thank you!"
1,Refunds take too long,"Refunds for returns are simply too long for it to be worth buying online to try on at home. I got a refund on the 23rd of December for a return that was received by Gap on the 9th of December. Still waiting for a refund for a return that they received on the 15th. I have no issues with the quality of the clothes, but I won't be buying from Gap again unless I can go to a store."
1,Was sent wrong item & Gap won't resend correct item,Loved shopping in gap when they had a store in Livingston. Since they have closed all Scottish shops was trying to avoid using them as I hate online shopping & the issues it bring with returns etc.  I did however give in & put in an online order which was sent to me with the wrong item. I contacted customer service to tell them of their mistake & ask for the correct item to be sent ASAP & I will return the item i didnt order however they are unwilling to do this. I need to re buy the product (at a higher price) send the incorrect item back & they will then send me my money back which to me is ridiculous considering the error was made by them in the first place.
1,Still no items.,"Ordered over a week ago, they use Yodel as a delivery service and cannot cancel an order that Yodel have clearly lost. So I now have no items and around ¬£80 down... fun times. Will NEVER use GAP again unless they use a better delivery service."
1,No tags and condoms in the pocket!,"I ordered jacket from Gap online,received it promptly by Hermes courier,but once I open the package to try it on I found the item without tags,obviously somebody returned the item which I assume was worn as there was condoms in the pocket!This was the first and last time I'll order from them."
1,I only gave it 1 star so I could write‚Ä¶,I only gave it 1 star so I could write a review about Gaps poor customer service as it is appalling if it goes into receivership I wouldn't be surprised. I went to the Westfield Store White City to see if it had an item in stock but they did not do I asked about click and collect and was told it would take 5 weeks. So I contact Customer Service who are no help at all and tell me they don't know how long it takes and that should phone other Gap stores myself to see if they have issues receiving orders really
1,Refund?,"On December 28th 2021, I returned a Christmas gift that was the wrong size, in its original packaging,and with all the relevant paperwork. I used the returns process as listed on the website. Since then, nothing. No confirmation of receipt, and certainly no refund. As it happens, I returned another parcel for the same reason to a different store at the same time, and have already had my refund. If other stores can do this efficiently at such a busy time, why is it so difficult for Gap?I emailed yesterday for further information, but still no reply. Come on Gap. Look after your customers.14:16Email received from Gap. I have to allow 15 to 20 days for a refund to be processed. Thanks for the info... Now please keep in touch."
1,Buy In-Store instead of Ordering Online,"I love GAP and their clothes but dear me, their deliveries and shipments are borderline atrocious. They still continue to use trashy parcel couriers like the thieving Hermes and Yodel. Lost my package after it arrived in Hermes' depot. How could you lose a package??? Customer Service was helpful and refunded the purchase. Goodness me GAP, please change couriers to Royal Mail or DPD or someone else other than Hermes and Yodel. How could you still operate with them if they continue to provide shoddy services to customers, even ones who use it for personal use.This experience really put me off from ordering from your company online ever."
1,Very poor service.,Ordered chinos but received a shirt with advice note detailing chinos ordered. I sent back the shirt and under comments detailed what had happened and asked for chinos I had ordered. I heard nothing for 12 days and had to telephone to ask for progress. I was told they had returned money to my account. I was told to re-order if I wanted chinos. Throughout there was no communication and no apology. I will not use the online service again.
1,What happened to Gap,"What happened to Gap? Used to be my favourite shop, but now when Next took over customer service is terrible. Also they are using Hermes/Evri as delivery company. If I knew before I paid for it I would never order it in first place. My order was left at the front door (by the pic I received in email). I was at work when order was delivered, the parcel wasn't there when I got home! Its been over a week now, and haven't heard from Gap, so no clothes I have paid for or refund!"
5,Amazing Value and Service!,I have done a few orders with Gap recently and have been pleasantly surprised with the quality of the items and speed of delivery. I also managed to grab some absolute bargains in the sale and all the sizes fit me perfectly. 5* for me.
1,Poor service and outdated terms and conditions,"Ordered a pair of jeans in their sale, paid ¬£4 postage.When they arrived the jeans were 4 sizes smaller and the ones I wanted were out of stock. Had to drive 5 miles to drop them off at a yodel pick up point. I then received an email to say that the cost of the jeans only would be refunded after contacting customer services who pointed out that their terms and conditions excluded refunding postage but on this occasion I would receive a refund.can I just point out to GAP that I was the person who received the wrong item and therefore am entitled to a full refund for wasting my time. After their announcement today about becoming completely online I would suggest they up their customer service and terms and conditions rather than blame the customer for their mistake"
1,Do not buy from Gap,"Do not buy from Gap, items are poor quality and over priced. Colours run from clothes with one wash and their customer service is shocking. Hopefully this is will the next business to go bust and make way for a company who shows some care for its customers."
5,Past orders have been received very‚Ä¶,"Past orders have been received very quickly. Made another order today and when a discount did not apply to my order as it was supposed to, the webchat lady amended the order in just a few seconds to the correct amount.This will be my go-to for jeans from now on."
1,"Avoid the headache, don't shop at Gap","I have not bought anything from Gap since I was in my 20's and I have never used their online service which is atrocious!I bought a pair of jeans and returned it the day after it arrived using their prescribed method. That was over 2 weeks ago and to be honest, I forgot all about it. Today, after being reminded about the transaction, I tried to find out what happened to my refund.The website is useless as one of the emails provided returned a message saying that the email was not in existence.I tried calling and I selected the numbers to speak about returns but all that does is terminate the call. I tried several times.Now, I have no idea how to contact them or how to get my money back Avoid the headache, don't shop at Gap."
1,I can't stand gap and the way how they‚Ä¶,I can't stand gap and the way how they deal with returning items. I have bought numerous things from gap which I needed to change and I was unable to change it because I was told it had to be changed at a gap outlet. To make matters worst all there gap outlets are far. I'm actually glad they are closing. It's just the inconvenience they cause you when returning.
1,In store manager,"In store manager - Gregory @ Gracechurch store - was rude to two customers that I could see. Very awkward standing in the queue waiting to pay, when he dispatched two customers trying to return faulty products. Leaves a very bad impression of the store, and the brand."
3,Not impressed with their masks.,"I made an order for some Jeans and shirts and ordered two sets of the masks they had on offer. Described as 'adult masks with wire in the nose bridge' these turned out to be of a size suitable for a 7 to 10 year old and the 'wire' had no flexibility or ability to it to hold any shape. They also felt very thin. I feel its a little irresponsible for company's to be selling things like this which are so unfit for purpose in the current environment. Also, annoyingly, such items cannot be returned so they ended up thrown away.The one Item I did return I had to chase and chase, first they said contact them after 30 days, then 30 working days and then an extra 14 days and then they just asked me what I returned and did refund that. While the tracking did show the order retuned to them within three days I guess they had lost it in their warehouse or something.To be fair to them they did respond to emails in an efficient manner and eventually refund for the one item returned. It wouldn't put me of ordering from them again but I'll stick to traditional clothing items."
1,I bought a couple of men's winter hats‚Ä¶,"I bought a couple of men's winter hats online checked out and paid, was then sent confirmation email with 4 v neck t-shirts and larger payment amount, called and cancelled , however they still sent me the delivery and charged me. Overall a terrible and weird online shopping experience where clearly something went wrong on their end and I am now left trying to return summer t-shirts !"
1,We wasted ¬£143 on GAP's website,"We wasted ¬£143 on GAP's website. Go and buy yourself a t-shirt from primark, literally no difference. At least you wouldn't have the feeling of being ripped off. Also, GAP wouldn't let you put reviews on items on their page. So we can tell people not to buy"
1,I have given up with Gap,"I have given up with Gap. I ordered black jeans, they sent blue ones. I then have to waste my time arranging collection for a product I did not even order. This is just lazy. When a business moves online, you do expect that they will be able to work as an online business. This is amateurish. I won't bother again."
1,Totally robbers.,Totally robbers.Gap outlet in Livingston sales on %30 . Plus additional %20 off if download their app at that time. Should be be totally %50 off .But they charged me full amount %0.I just checked the receipt & complaint to them. Send the photos of receipt.Check ur receipt u might overpaid as well!!!
1,Poor customer service at Gap outlet,"Poor customer service at Gap outlet, items on rails with 50% off signs. When items were taken to the till to purchase the items were not 50% and staff said we should look at the small print dispite the same items being on several rails with the same sign. Very miss leading."
5,I couldn't fault the service I've had‚Ä¶,I couldn't fault the service I've had over the last couple of weeks. I placed three separate orders on different days and each one came the next day.
1,I really like Gap but‚Ä¶,"I used to really like Gap but having waited over 48 hours for a large online order to ship I gave up. There was no way of cancelling online so I spoke to a customer rep. She said she would ""start the process"" and I should get an email in about 3 days (!!) and that any refund would take two weeks. Unbelievable. Why Gap can't ship faster and why they then don't refund immediately is a mystery. I suspect they will soon be out of business if this is their approach to online shopping. A shame as I like the clothes."
2,Awful customer returns!!!!!,"Ordered some men's shorts and returned them as a poor fit. Sent them back 48 hr Royal Mail. After a couple of emails and almost 2x weeks gap sent me an email saying they have received my return and will refund in a couple of billing cycles ... in other words from postage to refund a couple of months!!! Absolutely rubbish, what if Amazon did the same? It doesn't 3 days till my last refund in the bank cleared!! Terrible way to do business. GAP sort it out it's silly and will only help you close more stores!!"
1,I just want to advise customers to stay‚Ä¶,"I just want to advise customers to stay away from GAP online. They send faulty items online. If you wear it once, they transfer color. They refuse to refund it and may only give you a store gift card, if you take them to store for a refund. It happened in my case, Since I could not find anything interesting in the store, I contacted them and asked about possibility of converting it to an e-voucher. After one month communications and sending me to a fool's errand, they did not refund me. They even asked for all confidential information such as all details of my credit card which I did not provide. After they realized that I am not so na√Øve, they apologized and told me that I have been refunded for the second time, but again it was only a lie. In addition, using my information they took all the credit of my store gift card. Seriously beware of them."
1,Terrible experience.,"Terrible experience.I ordered some jeans which were shown in stock. The next day I got an email saying they weren't in stock and I wouldn't be charged. The email was repeated in German underneath and, bizarrely, it talked about ""this offer is available until"" a particular date. It was such a weird email that I had to double check it was real. I sent a complaint to customer services who said that someone must have ordered the last item at the same time as me. Hmm.Well, lo and behold, I *was* charged and now I'm having to chase up a refund. I'll not shop with them again.Edit: the payment was finally reversed today, a week later, during which period they had indeed taken my money."
1,What a shambles,What a shambles.  Inundated with promos sent to my inbox that amount to nothing.  A website that can't even find my address after I have manual input it. I haven't even made a purchase and I am frustrated and disappointed.
1,Nothing good i can recommend,"So ive done my first order this afternoon, all order was cancelled due to everything was out of stock. Really?! All 8 items were out of stock?! Waiting refund. First and last my order. Thanks for great first experience ordering online @gap"
1,Worst experience i ever had on online‚Ä¶,Worst experience i ever had on online shopping. Ordered item 5 days ago and still no sign of shipment. Customer service useless.Dont waste your time and buy from someone else you trust.
1,Inconsistent customer service.,"Inconsistent customer service.Bought in store and wanted another pair so ordered online. What arrived was the wrong size. Phoned customer service and they were unhelpful and not interest in helping. I will have return what they sent incorrectly, I then will need to order again online, to then phone Gap back to honour so that they can honour the  price. Gap you put me at an inconvenience and you carried on by making it more inconvenient by me having to phone you back - customer comes last‚Ä¶.!!!I am the ones that needs to go to the post office and use my petrol. The person to order again online (my time) and then phone you back for yet probably another back and forth to honour the price.And reading the other comments I look forward to my refund taking weeks (and suspect many more phone calls) and unhelpful customer support!Always bought gap jeans but after this experience, see you later!"
1,GAP ..well there is a big GAP in their‚Ä¶,GAP ..well there is a big GAP in their customer service staff are rude and you are made to feel like you're an inconvenience to them when there are 3 staff members clearly to busy gossiping with themselves to acknowledge there are customers to serve ..no sorry about that or be you in a minute we the customers have to approach you to get served and are made to feel bad for doing so I will never give my custom to the store again ever also tried to give the feedback via the info on the receipt for it to say it was not a valid store number !! Clearly need to bridge the GAP with customer service training !
1,Insincere with no integrity,Ordered an item (twice) on both occasions got the wrong colour. Rang CS. The lady I spoke to was very pleasant. As requested I sent the items back. I simply requested in return they send me the correct item.  They haven't done this and they've only refunded me for one item.  I rang them today to be told I would have to go online to reorder because they have a 'new system' so they can't do this!  I've taken the trouble to report THEIR issue and taken the time to return the items for THEM.  They are a multi-million dollar world-wide company and they haven't got the capability (or courtesy) to send out a pair of knickers!  Really??  Pathetic GAP.  You're just like alot of other corporations.  Insincere with no integrity.
2,Placed an order,"Placed an order, only received part of it. Had to email asking for the remaining order days later and was told it could take 10 business days to get it. Shocking in the age of 2 hours amazon delivery?  Item quality was not that either. Scared to send back for refund as it might take 100 business days to get a refund"
1,One star for new site.,"One star for new site.Same as Next. Absolutely wrong, uncomfortable, not nice.Will not buy anything no more. Loved my old good GAP before with cash back. Will miss so much! No more unfortunately for me("
5,Can't fault them first time ordered‚Ä¶,"Can't fault them first time ordered 19/4 and received goods on standard delivery 20/4 well packaged and presented, so many companies tend to send out screwed up and badly packaged these days so this was a refreshing change üòÄ"
1,REFUND NEVER GIVEN!!,"Before ordering from gap.co.uk you may want to read this review carefully.They have been owing me ¬£135 (NOT a penny!!) since October 2019. I simply bought some clothes online and returned some of them in store. After a month, I realised I hadn't received my money back. So, I called their customer service, they asked me for a receipt of the return that I had and I STILL HAVE. They apologised as the missed refund was due to a mistake by their store staff. After one month, they confirmed they had refunded me the money, apologising again for the mistake.I have been chasing, chasing and chasing them and they still owe me ¬£135!! I NEVER GOT MY MONEY BACK.I really don't know how a big company can ignore an unhappy (previously loyal) customer's emails. It's unbelievable!This is FRAUD and I absolutely can't accept other customers to fall for something similar. BEWARE!"
1,Rubbish customer service,"Ordered jeans on the website - the warehouse sent the wrong jeans (totally different style and colour ). I rang to ask the right ones were sent and told that they can't do that - I have to return the ones I got and reorder the right ones (again). I sent the original wrong order back and over 2 weeks later I am still waiting for my money back . I have emailed and received a stock computer generated response that my refund will take at least 15 working days from when they process it ! I had advised THEY sent the wrong item and that according to tracking , the jeans had been delivered to them over 2 weeks ago - but still this hasn't made any difference and no one wants to help . The worst customer service ever , needless to say I have not reordered the jeans I wanted - I won't bother trying to do business with gap ever again . Very bad company to deal with"
1,Appalling Click & Collect service,I ordered 2 items from these lot on a 2 business days delivery.It's now 5 days after and the order is still saying 'on its way to the courier'.Customer services too slow to respond.Appalling service.
5,Sales wins,"Ordered a few smart but casual shirts for the wife and some kids clothes (not for the wife) online in the sale... Really nice choice at great prices and delivery was very quick.Don't think I'll be buying at full price, but the sale stuff is defo worth the money!"
1,Steer clear of this unhelpful store,"I've had a 3 month ongoing disaster with a team that doesn't know what they are doing. I received a gift in the wrong size from a relative who lives over 200 miles away. All I wanted was a smaller size. After nearly 3 months, I was issued with a gift card and told that if I called them up, they would help me use it online as I live over an hour away from a store. On calling them up, neither Barbara who I spoke to or her manager Tamara who refused to come and speak to me on the phone, knew anything about redeeming gift cards over the phone. The item I wanted a size smaller in is now on sale and likely to go out of stock. It should not be this difficult to deal with a simple gift exchange.Steer well clear, the staff don't have a clue what they're doing and are extremely unhelpful just telling me to call back the following day."
1,Unhappy,"Very unhappy with the service, they used to send things promptly, not anymore, they cannot even provide an estimated date for delivery!I contacted them today, they promised to cancel this order and submit the refund. They promised to send a confirmation email, I have received no communication from them. Really poor, unprofessional customer service."
4,Swift delivery,"Swift delivery, sizing information on the website was very useful. Returns are free so it's no problem if they don't fit."
1,Full of rubbish Gap,Full of rubbish Gap. I ordered some goods from Gap in September they took money out from my account then they put money back. Now after three months they are writing that money will come out from my account within 2-5 working days. They never asked me if it's okay with me or if I have money now. As a good gesture they offer me 20% off for my next shopping stating that this offer it's very good üòÑ. Gap you can keep your 20% I don't need that.
5,Gap  mostly do very good  quality ‚Ä¶,Gap  mostly do very good  quality  items. Can be a bit expensive but their sale prices are excellent as is the fast delivery.
1,Terrible service,"Terrible service. Ordered item on the 29th December and it still hasn't arrived (nearly 1 month later).Ordered through GAP.EU (and before the 1st Jan 2021) to avoid Brexit custom charges, yet I have still been charged ‚Ç¨18 ""clearance"" fee.I will not be ordering from GAP again."
1,First time will be last time!,"First time I've ordered with Gap and will be the last time. Ordered 4 items, returned 2 on Nov 10th. Still nothing changed on the returning status, and still waiting for a refund. Customer service does not respond at all. Stay away from Gap. I thought this was a well run company, now I have big trust issues"
1,Feel robbed,Places an order. Haven't received it. Tried emailing and told they could not respond. Tried calling and answer machine said could not respond due to an emergency situation. Shocking. How do I get my money back?
1,Rather disappointed.,"Rather disappointed.I have used Gap for years and have been happy with their shops and clothes that I have bought from them.However, for the first time I ordered online from them. This hasn't been the best experience. They are quick to take payment but refunds don't seem that quick. My experience with another well known big online retailer is that they process refunds on day of them receiving the item.I sent an item back to Gap. And then wrote to them regarding my refund but got a reply saying it hasn't been processed yet. Despite the courier company showing it as having been delivered to them.I shall continue to use their shops because I like their clothes. Had it worked out I would have bought a lot more from them online. But I shall have to wait and buy on the occasions when I am near one of their shops."
5,Love the quality of the clothes and‚Ä¶,"Love the quality of the clothes and choice of baby clothes is just excellent. Ordered a jacket for my daughter, its so soft and a perfect fit. Delivered super quickly."
1,Incredibly low quality,"I bought a pair of long sleeves PJ for my grandchildren at the extortionate price of ¬£24.95 and ¬£22.95. The fabric is so thin, I doubt they could be worn in winter.  I was going to keep them anyway, but the size of the garments is totally ridiculous. I ordered for 10 and 13 years old. The trousers are extremely long, but incredibly narrow, they would not fit a 6 years old. The tops may have been fine, but the sleeves are ridiculously narrow. GAP use to sell good quality, good value for money clothes,I hadn't bought anything from them for quite a while, but I am not going to risk it again."
1,What happened to the usable website where you could see what you were buying?,"I've used GAP online a lot over the past couple of years. Even more so since the Pandemic (even though the masks I bought from them were only fit for the bin). The delivery is always quite quick and it WAS a very easy to use website.I've just gone to get some essentials for my other half and what has happened to the website? The images are tiny and you can't see the material of the products, its dificult to navigate, twice I got error pages. I know nobody likes change but this is a massive step backward as afar as using the website goes. In fact it now feels like a website from ten years ago. I gave up in the end and went to have a look and the M&S website. Please GAP, look at making a user friendly site where it is easy to browse and see the products we are looking to buy. Reading other comments, yes, thats it, Next, its the Next website isn't it, which was never any good and felt like they couldn't be bothered and wanted you to visit a store instead. Why have they gone this route?!?"
1,"Two orders, two lost in transit","Twice I ordered clothes to my local store, twice they didn't get delivered and twice I've had to chase.  Frankly a very poor delivery service which cannot be relied upon.  Will not be using again."
3,I used to love GAP quality but they are‚Ä¶,"I used to love GAP quality but they are not like they used to be I was disapointed with a women coat I bought from them online and men tshirts that I bought for my son, because they come in packs of two they are not the same quality as those sold single. Additionally, I got chocked when I found out that all the stores has been closed down In London so I had to return the items via post office and that is taking ages for them to receive the return and refund the money."
1,Worst company when it comes to shipping‚Ä¶,"Worst company when it comes to shipping and customer service! I ordered a Yeezy/Gap Jumper, it's been 20 days and see no delivery.Stay far away from GAP!"
5,Great atmosphere,"Great atmosphere, very polite and friendly staff and delicious hot fresh food. I would recommend the Muston Gap to everyone"
3,'Known issues' on website mean experience is painful.,"The quality of Gap kids' clothing is excellent and since there is always a sale of some description on, they can be a decent price too. HOWEVER for a large multinational, their website and online offering is terrible. In the past I've had issues with it being very buggy ( not displaying info correctly, unable to sign in, unable to 'press' buttons etc. Most recent experience is that no email was sent after purchase, and purchase was not shown anywhere in my online profile - disappeared into thin air ( and has still not been found!)! Luckily I had screen grabbed the (quickly disappearing) order confirmation screen and called customer services. Apparently this is a 'known problem' for which the American call centre welcomes my feedback - grrrr! if you know its a problem, FIX IT! Seemed tremendously glib and couldn't resolve. Now have no idea when items might appear/ cannot amend/ lack confirmation of price paid/ items ordered etc - fairly basic stuff! However am 'assured' 'don't worry we can see the order, even if you can't'. An unfortunate, unsolvable ( apparently) issue topped by poor customer service & grasping at straws - ""oh you should clear your entire cache (that will resend the missing email, will it?,)""  I do like Gap, just a shame they can't be bothered looking after customer experience for people like me."
1,Great Product Poor Service,"Took my money . Did not deliver. Have not given refund. Blacklisted my e-mail.Looks like I would win in court, but just not worth the hassle to pursue.So sfter 47 pairs of GAP Chinos all bought in shops I will have to use another brand."
1,Awful,"Awful - if I could give zero stars then I would. Gap used to be good for well priced, durable basics but no more. I ordered a large amount due to being unsure on the sizing and needing a lot of items for work. I have never had to return this many items to any retailer before. Sizing - all over the place. One small vest was so tiny it wouldn't go over my shoulders. The same vest in a different colour was massive. Shirts in a medium looked like something a clown would sport. Quality - what on earth was happened here? I don't expect to pay near ¬£40 for a top for it to look and feel cheaper than the equivalent from a well known high street fast fashion chain. Three washes and they look like they'd fall to bits. Not to mention the proportions were way off. The smell - yep, the smell. Anything in the order that claimed to be ‚Äòcotton' smelled like vomit. Despite everything having its own individual plastic wrapper. Joy. I'm really disappointed and at this point I'm hoping I get my money back. Just don't bother."
1,Never again,Terrible service. I ordered from gap.eu on the 29th December and it still hasn't arrived (almost 2 month later). I asked for a cancellation of my order and I asked to them to return my money and they didn¬¥t. I will not be ordering from GAP again.
1,Ordered stuff more than 3 weeks ago,Ordered stuff more than 3 weeks ago . Chased so many times with Hermes . Still same . Asked me to contact gap they refunded which I didn't want and in the end my order is no where with no tracking details . Extremely frustrated

1,Their outlet in Grace Church street in‚Ä¶,"Their outlet in Grace Church street in london was selling mens trousers ordinary Chino for ¬£19.99 .They put them on sale guess what @ ¬£27.99 when i confronted their sales woman all she can say is"" good luck""Also i bought a pair of jeans for ¬£27.99 after sale during Xmas time and wife spotted that it was used item.Luckily i had the receipt and manage to return it.Today the same item is sold @ ¬£37.99 appatently slashed price from ¬£59.....Simply .....avoidNever buy from GAP.Cheats"
1,Rude and bad service. Very patronising,"A very rude employee spoke down to me and my friend because we are younger than most of the shoppers she expected us to be rude and to mess about. We entered the changing room and it was very informal without any signs to indicate what to do after trying on the clothes. We had attached all of the clothes to their pegs and folded them and placed them on the bench as we could not see the employee to give them to. Then the employee came out and said that it was incredibly rude and we should be nicer to her. I understand retail is a hard job and many mistreat workers but in this case she was not doing her job of being visible to give the clothes to so we did the next best thing and got yelled at for her not doing her job well. She rolled her eyes and made rude comments. I can not comprehend how someone this patronising and childish can work at a respectable shop. I am mortified, as is my friend and we were not doing any harm and not intentionally being unhelpful. We were made to feel embarrassed and I never want to go back because I felt like I had been shamed for not knowing what to do. I'm an appalled by the rude service. Never going back."
1,No way of speaking to anyone if‚Ä¶,"No way of speaking to anyone if problems with your order. I ordered 3 weeks ago, problem with the transport company, they told me i need to go baco to Gap and i cant speak to anyone at Gap. Now im ¬£200 down. Will never use again"
5,I've always had a good experience with‚Ä¶,"I've always had a good experience with Gap, whether ordering online or in store, and the clothes are consistently good quality. Recommend making the most of their excellent sales."
1,Terrible new website,"I used to buy a lot online, I really loved the old version. I am here to comment on the new website - just a terrible format! Every time I go on it, I just give up after a minute. I do not like it at all which is shame as previously I would rate 5*"
1,The worst customer service ever,The worst customer service ever. I returned the items to UK. The returns were sent on 13 April and did not reach return center until 8 May 2019!!!???? Almost a month!?
1,GAP and GDPR,"I asked for the data that GAP hold about me for more than a month.It happened after that GFAQP systemically delivered my order to my old address. That old address was nowhere in my GAP's address book. After a lot of obstacles, my request is still ON. I wrote to GAP and I still do not have my own data, regardless to GDPR. Something is fishy. Every company I asked my data, quickly delivered. GAO does not. Maybe shall I sue GAP to get my datas in time instead of a promise to get my data later?"
2,Absolutely shocking,"Absolutely shocking, can't send an item back for exchange of size without repaying for the item straight away. Send back your item and 3 weeks later still no refund!! Quick enough to take your money but don't want to give it back!Called and all they said was well hopefully soon.I can't deal with hopefully. They don't seem to realise we are not all made of money.I want my money back!"

5,Great quality clothes,"Every item I bought was of great quality for my little girl. Washes great, long lasting clothes and decent prices when they have an offer on."
1,Poor aftersales - no gift card use on website,"Another supposedly large clothing company who cannot provide an acceptable level of customer service, they just waffle around the subject with no answers and no resolution. GAP clothing advertise that you can use all4one gift cards but I was unable to do so and was given no comprehendible explanation."

1,Some Legal Attuning Required,"Return acknowledged and refund allegedly processed last Wednesday, Jan 12th. Inconceivably yet to be received and zero compulsion on the part of customer services to investigate the breach of contract."
1,"They won't be around much longer, thankfully!","GAP should stick to what they're good at; promoting partisan political issues and spreading propaganda through their ads and social meida, as I'm afraid the curtains are finally closing on their place in the retail industry and I for one could not be happier."
1,WEMBLEY STORE MANAGER,WEMBLEY STORE MANAGERRude. Rude. Rude. I hope she finds some customer service skills soon.
1,Zero customer service.,Zero customer service. You can't do anything about it but wish them to be damned. Hope they choke on food they buy with the money they steal from me.
1,I bought two items from the vip event‚Ä¶,"I bought two items from the vip event for my son from Gap Canary Wharf a few days ago. I wish I didn't. I buy most of my son's wardrobe from Gap but not anymore. Your staff is so rude attitude. The cashier seemed as if she couldn't be bothered to serve and she wanted to get over and done with. First i was overcharged by ¬£10+ by the cashier. She was in a rush for no reason. There was one person behind me in the queue. I felt something was wrong so I checked the receipt and I queued again to tell her that she scanned the expensive item twice. Very quick and the most insincere apology. It felt like she was annoyed with me for bringing it up. Doing a few scans and then pretty much looking at me as if I should leave now. I clearly wanted to double check my receipt but she told me I refunded you ¬£10 twice. So basically asked me to move by rolling her eyes so she could start dealing with the next client. It felt like something was wrong again. I then rechecked the receipt and realised i was not given the %5 off the app discount. I waited for her to finish her business and told her and she rolled her eyes again and asked me to cover at which point I was very annoyed. Behaving as if she doing me a favour is not an attitude that I was going to take. I said I didn't want it and left. Then I thought well why do I buy so much from a company that has such client service? A few days later I returned the item. On that day, I came across this lady again and she was arguing with another member of staff."

1,GAP Kingston upon Thames,"GAP Denim Jeans feeback for Kingston Store (Sean):I always purchase my jeans from GAP, this the second time my jeans has worn off, I went to GAP store based in Kingston upon Thames, the store supervisor named ""Sean"" refused to exchange the jeans and said that this jeans has been used and she would not replace it, she was extremely rude that we are not supposed to replace any items once its been used, I told her that when I was purchasing this jeans, I had explained to her colleague the problem I face with jeans and she assure me that if next time this happens, then keep the receipt safe and they will replace the worn jeans, this is so frustating that the customer service of GAP has fallen to such a low level and another thing is the quality of the stretch cloth which get worn out with normal use. I have decided that I would never buy my clothes from GAP as the above experience and also advise my friends & family to avoid buying from GAP as per this untrustworthy experience."

2,Gap Bromley High Street,"Went to Gap Bromley High Street the other day to get trousers for my son. Forgot my glasses at home and asked for help from staff. Useless and lazy. She is called Maria. It was 16:30 and she looked more interested in tied up the Shop to get home faster than to help us. I picked a size didn't fit well but where Maria was???? who knows.Went upstairs to ask for a Manager who was talking happy with another member of staff. Without even saying sorry, she said: would like me to help you? but with a body language and intonation that she didn't really meant to and off we went with an empty hand. Very poor Customer Services. I would like to apologise for forgetting my glasses at home and to bother them."
1,Gap.co.uk deserve NO stars,"Gap.co.uk deserve NO stars. The worst customer service ever. The order took 10 days to arrive, and although I returned the items immediately to Westfield London store, I'm still waiting for a refund. Unacceptable online service, will not be shopping online with them ever again."

I've sent them 3 emails, 1 live chat, 2 phone calls  because of my refund and still nothing.... They said different things about getting my  refund, first they said I'll get my refund in 15 days but then they changed it to 25 days.IT IS VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!!!"
5,Fantastic!,"Made a substantial order on Monday last week and the items were all delivered to my door, well packaged and quickly. In fact the whole order was at my door on Wednesday of the same week by 4pm. Will order again and they offer fantastic discounts and great customer support for customers."
3,Worn out/out of use/ancient maternity clothes. The range looks like something your grandma would buy,"I used to be really satisfied with gap until I had to look for maternity clothes. The range they have it's a joke! In my opinion and I have a feeling I am not the only one with this opinion. They have  worn out/out of use/ancient maternity clothes. I have browsed and bought maternity clothes from next, john lewis, topshop EVEN Vertbaudet(you may have not heard of them but they offer quality new age clothes) and many others. I could never wear anythig feom Gap. Those clothes look like something my grandmother would buy! Honestly guys I would give you 1 star if I would have not been satisfied with your normal range. We're in 2018, live a little and pay better designers!"
5,One of the few companies i trust to one‚Ä¶,One of the few companies i trust to one get my order right and two deliver when they say they would.
4,Great delivery but slow return process.,"I love GAP clothing and delivery is very prompt. However, saying that their return/ refund service is extremely slow is an understatement. I have never experience anything like it. It took almost 2 weeks to receive confirmation of returned item received. I then noticed that their email notification includes the following statement ""If you paid with a credit card, your credit should appear on your statement in one to two billing cycles"". Wow! Patience is a virtue indeed in this case.Update: The refund appeared on my statement within 2-3 working days. Given this, I am upgrading the review to 4 stars. Yes it took longer than most but have to say shipping and refund related details are accurate."
1,Awful Customer Services,"Returned an item on the 28/05, started a web chat today with a lady named Kathy S, to find out about my refund, all she could say was there's a delay in returns, so here have 10% off another order and she hopes I'll shop with them again, when I said i wouldn't shop with them again as I still haven't sorted my refund, she said ok have a nice Sunday and ended the chat. Sort this out Gap üò°"
1,Absolutely terrible service in UK Gap‚Ä¶,"Absolutely terrible service in UK Gap stores, Hampstead NW3 specifically.Stuff is rude, unfriendly and unprofessional.Quite a few of them  chatting on the sales floor.  Discussion personal matters and  bickering while ignoring customers - always sour facial expressions. The service used to be much better at that branch years ago."
1,Placed orders on line in 3 different‚Ä¶,Placed orders on line in 3 different ocassions in the last couple of months.Three times I received items that I did not order and random sizes .Disgusting.
1,ONLINE,"ONLINE - this is a review of their online store. Atrocious! Very dated and sends you to different pages you don't even click on! When I eventually got through to placing my order, and having put in my details and clicked pay, it sent me back to my orders page, this happened numerous times...so much so that I ended up cancelling my order and going else where...Joke!"
1,WORST SERVICE,"WORST SERVICE I HAVE EVER BEEN GIVE IN MY LIFE! I got to the check out when a member of staff come to eventually serve me. She started serving me with no conversation and looked frustrated. I smiled but nothing! The only words I got out of her was the price of my stuff. Then I asked for a gift box, she didn't know how to do that. Little to know I then go and find out she's the store manager! After bitting another staffs members head off for trying to kindly help she said she'll just charge me as a normal bag. Save money I did but come back, I would never! And I would never recommend it. Never go to the gap in the Trafford centre!!"
1,Shocked and disgusted!,"Shocked and disgusted!I went to the gap store (angel and islington branch) just before new years to see if there were any post christmas deals.What I arrived to at the store was absolutely disgusting and horrifying! A young pregnant lady being harassed and threatened by a member of staff!!!! I could not believe what I bore witness too, this young lady was pushed by a male member of staff and when she cried out to express her concern he then began to threaten to physically assault her! I am beyond disgusted at this behaviour and I have nothing but sympathy for this poor woman. To think a pregnant woman can not be safe to go shopping to a retail store. absolutely abysmal! Gap please vet your candidates i can't believe you hired such disgusting and callous person."
2,The low rating is due to the staff - Rude & Uncaring,"The low rating is due to the staff and not for the apparel. The staff, in general, seem to be rude, uncaring and stiff. Buying online is far better than having to interact with the staff. As everywhere, there are some exceptional staff. But in GAP, they seem to be rare."
1,Absolutely awful,"Awful. First, it takes ages for them to send the order. Second, it takes ages (2 weeks!) to confirm they have received a return. Third, it takes ages for them to actually refund your money (I'm still waiting, a week after confirmation they received the last parcel). Fourth, their sizing is terrible. I originally ordered a UK size 14, and have received instead a 10, then a 12 and then another 10 after calling customer service twice to request they send me the correct size. Needless to say, each delivery took ages to arrive. Presumably the mess up over sizes was because of the US/UK sizing differences, a UK 14 being a US 10. But that's not acceptable. I have absolutely given up on GAP."
1,Utterly dreadful dispatch times,"Utterly dreadful dispatch times. Ordered 26th November, still not shipped. Luckily I didn't pay the extra for express delivery this time, as that has still taken over a week from order in the past."
1,I'm surprised Gap is still in business,"I'm surprised Gap is still in business.  I submitted an order SEVEN days ago and it's still pending shipment.  In the interim, the cost of my order has nosedived so I just re-submitted my order for ¬£20 less, and I'll cancel my old one.  Of course this will require me waiting for their US-based customer service hours.  Their delivery time is literally about 15x longer than anyone else I know of these days."
5,One of my favourite clothing brands.,"I've shopped with them many times and I've always been very happy! Orders to my local store arrive quickly and even if I prefer to return something that's not a problem at all, they give me a refund on the spot! One of my favourite clothing brands."
1,No money refund and very bad website,Horrible experience and I don't recommend shopping online with GAP. I decide to return part of my online order and it took them about 2 weeks to send me a return confirmation of receiving my parcel and now (2 weeks later) I'm still waiting for refund my money. The Gap t&c says it can take up 2 bank statements to appear!!! Their website also works horrible. That's shame because cloths are really nice.
1,Sent the wrong order,"I ordered a t-shirt online to collect in store. I was impressed at first as collecting in store was free and my order arrived 2 days after I placed it. However when I opened it I realised I'd been sent something completely different to what I ordered. Also their sizes must run extremely small because I'm a size 8/10, the t-shirt I was sent is an XL and fits like a glove."
1,The worst shopping experience I've ever ‚Ä¶,"The worst shopping experience I've ever had on an online store. Completely useless, free delivery didn't work, valid promo code didn't work, live chat was useless, timed out twice. I ended up paying full price just so I could get off the site. In shock that a company of this size can produce such a shocking eCommerce experience."
3,Great products shame about the couriers,Th booking process for jeans was convienent but the courier experience with Hermes courier was terrible.Customer service was very understanding but no delivery notification of jeans at store due to a fault so I had to chase customer service to learn that my packagr arrived. Due to Hermes I would not shop online with GAP.
1,Price doubled overnight,"For many years I have been purchasing Gap's 'Pullover bra' which was an excellent purchase, priced at ¬£14.95. Every now and again, seasonal colours were temporarily added to the range which sat alongside the standard colours they continually ran.Early this year after a long long wait without new colours, finally a new 'Light Pink' colour was introduced. Straight away this was priced at ¬£29.95, more than double the price of the standard colours which it sat alongside, these were still priced at ¬£14.95. I thought this was a mistake, but then a few weeks later the standard colours leapt in price overnight straight from ¬£14.95 to ¬£29.95!!!! and the style name changed from being called 'Pullover bra' to now being called 'Cotton bralette'.Now even if there is one of their usual '30-40% off' events, this bra will still be more expensive than the full price it was a month or so ago. How can they do this and think this is acceptable. I think this is bad and I am very disappointed the price was hiked in such a manner."
4,All good except payment service,All good except payment service. Don't understand wgy to keep freezed money and charge once more when goods deliverd
2,Sent wrong goods,"Ordered goods online as the product was not in store. Goods dispatched very quickly to store for delivery next day, but the wrong goods were dispatched. Arrived in time, but completely the wrong product."
3,Slightly disappointing first shop,"Was looking for sale items, but didn't find the website particularly user friendly in terms of easy search facilities. Delivery was fairly expensive, slow (don't expect to wait 4-5 days any more! and no tracking facility ) and when they eventually arrived the clothes were way too small for my skinny 13 year old (perhaps this was why they were in the sale?)My nearest shop is 100 miles away, so am judging purely on website experience."
4,Quality clothing that lasts years,Gap makes quality clothing that are well fitting and last ages. I have capris that I've worn to work every week spring to summer over 5yrs and are as good as new once I dyed them back again after at least 100 washes. I'd have given 5* but my local store closed & the website charges delivery & didn't provide any tracking info but my package did arrive randomly 3 days later.
4,Nice t shirts,Love the t shirts that gap provide - can always guarantee the same size & fit!
5,Baby gap clothes are a great deal!,Great value for the money specially on sales!
4,Wonderful Customer Service,"We have ordered from GAP online several times and are very happy indeed with the very helpful customer services. Lovely products, I do feel however the quality could be better, especially for the prices, compared to other brands of similar costs etc.However, all in all, lovely company and lovely designs, all good!"
4,"Good quality, washed poorly","Originally from Germany, I was always told about GAP. Then I enjoyed the variety of clothing they had, the prices at which they could be purchased, and the material. Unfortunately, they did not wash as well as I expected. I separated my sweaters accordingly. Unsure what happened!"
5,Just awesome!,"Bought a few items, workout clothes, baby clothes and all. All was delivered on time. I'd recommend the website to a friend, I've done so already actually!"
4,Good quality items.,"Customer service advisors are friendly and helpful. Excellent quality items  and consistent sizing-  but the  drawback  to ordering online is the ¬£4 delivery charge, which, unless you are   spending ¬£50  or more,  seems expensive, in my opinion.  Also the size xxsmall is only  available online."
3,Delivery charges,"Hi,

Just researched and apparently if you order online and wish to return the product, you should get a full refund - including delivery charges!
Not so with the Gap - I am going to stop ordering on-line, as essentially I am giving Gap money for nothing if I decide I do not like it. 
They are one of only few clothing retailers, that do not offer a free delivery or collect from store service. They often do not have all product in stores or many sizes...so I end up ordering on-line, not any more."
