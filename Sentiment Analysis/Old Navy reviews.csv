1,Sent me the wrong order and won't refund,"Only Old Navy would send you the entirely wrong items and then refuse to refund you for it! I received the wrong items in my order, and contacted customer service about it. They would not reship the items, and also were requiring for me to return the items in order for me to get a refund even though it's their mistake. In order to bring the items to a UPS store to return, I would have to pay to take public transit there and back so they are effectively asking me to spend my own money to correct their mistake just to be eligible for a refund. This is completely unacceptable customer service."
1,I was a weekly customer but since the…,"I was a weekly customer but since the gap card went to Barkley Bank, the perks have disappeared. I’m no longer ordering online and paying shipping when I’m a card holder. I’ll go to stores that give their card holders those deserved perks. Plus service had also deminished."
1,Rude Agent- Inquiring About An Order I Didn’t Make,"(Old Navy) I received an electronic receipt via email, it was my email address but someone else’s order. I was disconnected twice live chatting with an agent. The third agent Marlika C. was very rude. I was just trying to make sure my PayPal account wasn’t hacked or if I received someone else’s receipt by mistake. I didn’t order anything from them and I definitely won’t order anything from them now after their rude behavior."
1,After placing an order and never…,"After placing an order and never received the item due to being lost in transit, Old Navy supervisor would not replace the item unless i paid for the item again or waited at least 5 days for the refund and then repurchased the item.  This was very upsetting because it was a gift so I had to pay for the item again in order to have it delivered in time.  Also the supervisor Janna hung up on me and never called me back.  I shop at many stores and have never received that kind of customer service.  If someone orders something and it is not fullfilled it should be replaced without repaying for an item.  Horrible customer service."
1,I ordered a decent size package from…,I ordered a decent size package from old navy and called them to tell them I am missing the boxesers I bought for my husband. They basically started yelling at me tell me my other wasn't there w s there was nothing they could do about it. Thr manager was rude condisindisind and didn't even offer to replace thr items I am flabbergasted gassted about this pissed the off no cousin no replaced nothing
1,Disappointed with Old Navy,"Ordered the reusable face mask and their add shoes beautiful mixed patterns, what I received are only 2 patterns on 3 orders and it is clearly a returned as the return address is GAP, Returns.   Will definitely return my entire order.  Poor customer service too."
1,Very disappointed in Old Navy this…,Very disappointed in Old Navy this year.  I ordered my gifts on December 5th and they didn’t arrive.  Called yesterday and they were overnighting my sons gifts which are now scheduled for Monday.  Huge Christmas fail and so disappointed as you were the bulk of his gifts.
1,Antiquated system that is not user…,"Antiquated system that is not user friendly. Placed an order and noticed the shipping address was incorrect. Called immediately to correct the address and was told they couldn't do it, the order had to be cancelled and items will need to be re-ordered with the correct address. They put in the cancellation, but it never actually got cancelled and now I am getting notified that the order shipped (to the wrong address.) They now tell me that I will have to wait until they are delivered to the wrong address before I can call and get my money back. By that time, I am sure all of the items will be off-sale and I won't be able to reorder at same price. You would think they would have been able to just change the address in the system to begin with."
1,I placed an order in Old Navy website…,"I placed an order in Old Navy website and there are a bunch of items missing. I had emailed customer service couple of time but they ignore me. Old Navy doesn’t value there customers. Since my money doesn’t mean anything to them, I won’t never buy again."
1,Never will I shop here again.,"Today I noticed a transaction from Old Navy on my visa. I have been in traveling and haven't had time to go shopping so I haven't been to Old Navy in about 2 months. I called my bank and they said Old Navy attempted to withdraw $175 for a credit card bill. I am underage so I do not have a credit card through them, nor did I want to. My bank refunded the amount, and my overdraw fee and told me to call Old Navy. I called and was asked 3 different times by different people for my social security number. Frustrated I explained that there was no way I was giving that to them after they just tried to seal almost $200 from me. After talking to 3 different people, and getting hung up on, the surpriser of credit cards said your credit card number was given by someone so there is nothing we can do. I usually shop at Old Navy often but NEVER again will I."
4,"Great clothes, not a huge fan of online shopping","I love Old Navy's clothes, but when shopping online it always seems that the only stuff in stock that I want is either in sizes XS or XXL, rather than stocking up more on in-between sizes. I've also had an experience when I had something in my cart, had to walk away for an hour or so, and then the price of the item went way up. Frustrating, but I absolutely love Old Navy's clothes so I'm definitely not going to stop shopping there."
2,I had a very shady experience here,"I had a very shady experience here. I had to constantly call them to finally get managers to review their tapes because I KNEW I didn't receive a bag of clothes. This is the Old Navy in New Market Square in Wichita, Kansas. They actually told me they reviewed the tape and that I received everything. After calling for what felt like the millionth time, they suddenly see on the tape that a bag was ""left behind"" the counter. I KNEW that I didn't receive them. They did give me my money back for the items, but it was ridiculous how it was handled. I will be shopping online only from now on. I did contact corporate about this and sent them an e-mail and NO response! One of my favorite stores, but terrible customer service."
3,customer service is outsourced,"customer service sometimes is routed to india and sometimes routed to latin america. the customer service in india is terrible. customer service in latin america is amazing.please close the india office and expand the latin american one.Also the customer service chat function is non-functional on the website, on multiple browsers. Please fix it. Chat-based customer service is easier and more efficient, as we can copy-paste order numbers, upload screenshots, etc.the website (oldnavy.com) is also a usability nightmare. too many things moving around.(this is for oldnavy.com)"
5,Meets expectatations,"While the fit of the clothes may sometimes be off, my online orders have always arrived on time and been packaged properly.  Ordering online is easy, I often order two sizes since it can sometimes be difficult to know the exact fits even with reviews.  Returning purchases is a breeze, which is why I would give them a 5 start rating.  You get what you pay for in terms of the pricing and quality of clothing."
5,Flattering Jeans!,"I’ve ordered here several times during the pandemic, before the pandemic I had never ordered before. I had the opinion that Old Navy didn’t have jeans for curvy women like me, boy was I wrong. They have some of the best, most comfortable, and flattering jeans! I love them, and recommend them to anyone. Shipping was sometimes slow, or super fast, which I’m sure was due to the sanitizing processes during the pandemic. A couple of jeans I ordered were too short for me, I easily returned them with the free returns that they offer, which was extremely convenient. I will be shopping here again in the near future!"
1,Charged debit card twice and 3 mos later,"I have been happy with Old Navy, they have done a good job of delivering during the pandemic. I understand that shipping takes longer these days. My problem is that my debit card was charged twice for the same order, 3 MONTHS LATER.  I check my bank account every day. The notation on the second charge even stated it was for a May 8th purchase. It took 2 phone calls and an hour to finally reach someone in customer service. The charge happened on a Friday and I called on Sat. The rep told me that it was ""a computer glitch. Purchases from May 7-May 11 were charged again on August 7th. The $$ would be REFUNDED on Monday"". ON gets to keep everyone's money for 3 days. earn interest on it and can even apply for more funding. I think ON thought people would not notice. This is fraud."
5,Old navy is my fav store,"Old navy is my fav store to shop at, being a credit card holder with Gap companies, i always enjoy shopping here. Things can b pretty affordable and they always have Sales for customers. Love it n enjoy shopping at old navy."
1,terrible ad on television. black guy should meet black  girl not a white one. really stupid ad,Ad on television about black guy meeting  white girl  crawling out windowShould have been black girl.  None in Comercial.  Really stupid ad. Makes me NOT want to shop at old Navy store
4,The website was clear and easy,"The website was clear and easy. The dress came when expected within a few days and looks great. Will use this brand.After visiting several websites, finally I found many beautiful clothes on this website. I love its varieties and I..."
4,XXL and beyond sizes are at Old Navy,"Nobody should ever take the nonsense that 'One size fits most'. 'Bod-Equality' is now their mission, according to their ads, as well as in business practice. Have a woman friend who needs size 3 X and 4 X.She loves when I bring her their oversized garments in which she can breathe easy. If you're waiting to exhale, give them a play, for sure."
5,I love Old navy,I love Old navy. They are Plus Size Friendly and they have great customer service. They Price match which is always nice. They always deliver with stylish clothes for the whole family. Will always shop here first for the family especially for the holiday season.
5,Good american brand and not many do…,"Good american brand and not many do realise it's a good old GAP or something like that, correct ? Cause I am totally out of my mind anyway with them, care to share there or what ? I do not want to make it all possible but we need to promote it much more if possible."
3,I purchased from here recently,"I purchased from here recently. My first order was a disaster. More than half of it was canceled because it was out of stock. I was then told through email that they could ship the canceled items from stores, but needed my physical address because they could not ship to a po box. I gave them my street address and then I was emailed again and told something else. The woman I reached when I called customer service was wonderful and understanding. I finally received the items that were in stock and was pleased with what I got. I hope my second order goes smoothly."
3,school uniform shirts,"I just bought my granddaughter 5 long sleeved uniform shirts. The price was for them were terrific. I don't feel that the fabric is as good as Wonder Nations or Academy uniform shirts. Their fabric is very soft and comes out of the dryer like ironed and brand new. Old Navy uniform shirts are not soft and have the wrinkle look when they come out of the dryer. But because they were so cheep, I shouldn't complain to much."
1,AVOID AT ALL COSTS! You may not get your order!,"I ordered a few hundred dollars worth of merchandise and Gap/OLDNAVY split the order up: 1 shipment with 14 items, 1 shipment with 1 item (a shirt). LASERSHIP is their preferred free shipping service. Almost immediately it showed shipment 1 as 'DAMAGED and UNDELIVERABLE, contact the shipper'. I contacted LASERSHIP many times with no reply and couldn't speak to a live person. They sent two standard canned responses but never followed up. GAP/OLD NAVY customer service would NOT give me a refund nor make good on the order by sending a replacement order. They said I would have to wait until the listed shipping date passed before they would give a refund. Never mind that not one person could tell me what happened to my package. Most of my experience with normal trusted shippers, not these lowest rated shippers in the USA called LASERSHIP, involved them always delivering a package even with damage. What exactly happened to a box of clothes that made it so damaged it couldn't be delivered? Destroyed in a fire? Water damage? Theft? Who knows?! GAP/OLDNAVY didn't care, only sent an email to LASERSHIP with no followup to me as promised! So me a customer left in the dark, money left on 'hold'. OR did GAP/OLDNAVY damage the package??!! WHO KNOWS??!!LASERSHIP amazingly did get the one shirt delivered on time!! WOW!!!! Imagine them doing their jobs! The bulk of the order, the other package deemed 'DAMAGED & UNDELIVERABLE' was sent back to the GAP by LASERSHIP and never to me.I called and got the refund after the shipping date passed and I didn't receive anything, although it took a few days to process. RUN from the GAP, OLDNAVY, BANANA REPUBLIC!!!  I will never shop at these stores again! Thanks for nothing and over 50 years of being a customer!! You are the worst retailers I know of in 2021!"
5,Slip on canvas sneakers,"Slip on canvas sneakers, I ordered at Old Navy.com. Good quality, comfortable, they were on sale, and just what I needed. Shipping went well. Good experience."
4,I love this place,I love old navy's clothes. I never have any problems with them. The only reason i didnt give them a 5 star rating is because the local store is always trashed so it takes a lot more time to find anything.
5,Love shopping at old navy for my 10 yr…,"Love shopping at old navy for my 10 yr old daughter, the recently had a 75% clearance sale, we were able to find item for under $3! That's better then most thrift stores!"
5,Quality Clothing,"They have great quality products and good designs. I especially love their swim section, which has a great selection for all body types. Great customer service too!"
4,Very Happy!,"I ordered from here a few months ago and everything was great. I was worried that one of my items might be out of stock because it was on sale, but everything was great. Shipping was pretty quick and everything arrived on time, right sizes and I will definitely order from here again."

1,Don't spend your money here,"This is the hint that no one works at Old Navy, you get no response from a review. Don't buy from this company garbage"
2,I am super disappointed in old…,"I am super disappointed in old navy.com.  usually don't have any issues except they are regularly slow shippers.So recently I order some things on June 11th and i decide that i need my things in a jiffy, so for the first time ever, i pay the extra 7 bucks to get my items in a week.....i get #2 of 3 packages on the day everything suppose to be here (june 18th).  I get #3 of 3 packages the day after (june 19th). I never received #1 of 3 which was actually sent out before any of the others according to their customer service line recording (2 hours on hold 3 different times with no live person to answer at all, btw).  I looked on ups.com its now not arriving until 23rd. (REALLY, oldnavy?!!!!!!!!) so I emailed customer service 3 times came back with auto messaging letting me know there isn't anyone to answer my email and to call the number.  On their website I tried to live chat but no one is available there either.....i can't believe THIS is what old navy has come to.  I just want my money back for the shipping and them to remove expedited shipping from the website for now or put a strike through on it because it's obvious they can't abide by their own promises and they aren't available to give refunds soooooo.....people are falling for that trap.  ""Here ya go pay for faster shipping, but hear our excuses about why we can't do that right now after you paid for it....and if u need our help with something, oh well😰😬you'll just have to wait for 3, 6 or 8 months or who knows how long because 'everyone's affected by covid19' 😩 and since this seems as good as any excuse to NOT do our jobs or anything.....we will just say it's due to the covid19 crisis.  so, valued customer, your just s.o.l getting your cash back you paid us for things and services that you didn't receive.  be sure to come back and shop with us again, ok?""Ummmm......yea?....nope"
