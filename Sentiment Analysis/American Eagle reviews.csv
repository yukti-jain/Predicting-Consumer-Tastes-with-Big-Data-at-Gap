5,i love the jeans they sell,"i love the jeans they sell, also love their shorts and shirts they are super cute and whenever i shop there they never disappoint me at all!"
5,Great,"I love American Eagle and have been thinking about writing a review but never got to it. So, in short, quality products at reasonable prices, a great reward program -   transparent, no small print, and real  substantial discounts. Most of all - very friendly customer service. Even, and especially, at times like these. Thank you."
5,Great online return experience,"After being denied by instore pacsun for my online Christmas gift paypal return, instore American Eagle returned items bought online with paypal purchased around same time. Clerk was nice too! Thank you AE!"
4,I ordered several articles of clothing…,"I ordered several articles of clothing for my teenage daughter and they came within a week. The shirts were of low quality (thin fabric, easily out of shape), except for two that were really great. I also ordered a ""fake"" leather jacket that is great for it's price and my daughters new favorite. I'd suggest to stay away from the cheap shirts but other than that the clothes seem to be ok."
5,My husband is 6’7” tall,"My husband is 6’7” tall, and whenever I shop for him it’s very hard to find the right size, but since American zeagle Outfitters make clothes for tall people as well, I shop online store often. I do love the quality a lot. It’s well made clothing store which I can recommend to my friends and family."
5,I have had wonderful expierences…,I have had wonderful expierences shopping at the stores or even online. People are typically friendly and helpful in the stores I shop in. Which is why I always keep bringing my business there.  There has been some mishaps with ordering online and in store a couple of times but when I talked to customer service on how to fix it they had always been more then helpful and fixed the mistake they had made. Mistakes happen but it’s in how they handle the process that helps make all the difference in your experience as a customer.
5,Excellent Services,"I normally don't spend over $20 when I purchase denim, but when it comes to this company, I am willing to spend a ton. The denim jeans are always great quality, and even better in person. The jeans are definitely a investment, that I recommend. The shipping is good as well. This is a great company to buy some good fitting, and looking denim!"
5,I like the quality of their clothes,I like the quality of their clothes. It's comfy and cozy to wear.
1,Cheap stuff,"I purchased a women’s short last summer which i can’t wear anymore as its waist elastic band does not stretch anymore, it is all loose. The customer service from American Eagle refuses to replace it or refund me because the shorts have been worn, even though i wore them 5 times at most. Looks to me  the merchandise they sell is cheap! Won’t get caught anymore buying their stuff."
5,The only Jeans and shorts I wear,"The only Jeans and shorts I wear! Absolutely love!! I mainly order online and the deals are awesome. The Jeans/shorts are great quality and a perfect fit. From the mom jeans, straight leg, tom girl, etc.. No issues at all I have 23 pair of jeans and 9 shorts as of right now. I'm going to keep adding on to my collection. If you have an issue customer service will take care of you!! No complaints so far and I've been shopping at American Eagle for years. If you are looking for a good quality and a pair of nice fitting pair of jeans/shorts American Eagle is the place to go!!!"
5,Plaid flannel shirts - one love,Plaid flannel shirts - one loveI bought two shirts 4 years ago. And I wore them every day. Cosy and warm. And still like new. Except some pellets because of my bag. But I fell off the scooter and tore my favourite green one. And I cannot buy a new one - because they all are oversized or cropped.. and I need a normal now.. Hope I'll find something in the next collection.
3,"Good clothes, unfortunate choice of delivery company in London","Just want to say love the clothes, live in the uk. Unfortunately their uk online company uses a delivery company called DPD and they are the worst company in the world so wanted to point that out here. Hopefully American eagle choose to use a different delivery company/people should just go to the store and buy the stuff they want - much less hassle."
5,The only jeans I ever buy!,"After trying many, many brands, American Eagle's jeans are the only ones that fit me like a glove! I love the quality - clothes are soft, wash well, amazing fit, good prices for what you're getting!"
4,American Eagle For The Older Crowd,"I love American Eagle shorts and tops.  The 4 inch inseams work great for me.  Being a young, active 57 year old, I appreciate the selection of shorts and the tops that are not cropped.  The quality of the clothes is always great and the sales keep me coming back!"
1,"Rude, obnoxious employees","We went to their store in Glendale, Arizona, and they had a man at the door, who demanded to know what we were going to buy. We told him we needed to look around to see if there was anything we wanted. Refused to let us in without detailing exactly what we would buy. We are retired, and not some punks looking to steal. Never heard of such conduct at any store, and we turned around and left, never to return. We talked about it later, and got the impression that he was enjoying himself acting like a jerk."
5,A dream for the booty!,"For a girl like me with an exaggerated hourglass shape, there are very few places I can shop for jeans. Most other jeans either can't make it over my hips, or if they do, there's a waist gap and they slip down all day long and I have to keep wiggling them back up. When I discovered AE's newest curvy high waisted jeans, I was blown away! They fit my entire shape like a glove and absolutely grip every curve! They're high waisted enough and snug enough on the waist that when they're pulled up all the way, they very rarely slip down, and they lift the booty sky high. The fabric is sturdy and feels like it holds you in versus jeans that feel so thin. When I wear my AE jeans, I know I'll get stares and compliments all day long!"
1,"Be carfull, import taxes can increase the price a 50% .....","I bought some boxers for my kids that costed a total of 56€. The big surprise came when the Fedex representative that brought the parcel made me pay 29€ in border taxes. I leave in Spain. I did not receive any alert when I was placing my order, and my confirmation email did not say a word. I complained to customer service and they said that their general terms and conditions state that any taxes must be payed by the customer. In the moment I was complaining there was a big banner in American Eagle website stating that they cover any import taxes. How a bran can be so cynical. Dear sirs in Amercan Eagle I've lost 29€, but you have lost much more that a customer."
5,It's a Jeans Day!,Really happy with the denim jeans I purchased. They were stonewashed and ripped and looked fantastic! Thank you American Eagle for making such awesome jeans
1,Terrible experience shopping site.,"Slow, frustrating web site. By the time you see any product you are no longer interested in waiting, waiting to see a different angle, waiting to see if they have your size or color.Also, very limited on selection so what's the HUGE DELAY...Frustrated will not visit or buy from site again!!!"
4,Love AE,"Delivered on time, and overall great product with the exception of a shirt that looked nice on the website but ended up being cheap looking. Other than that I loved everything I ordered"
4,Super easy and they always come before…,Super easy and they always come before the estimated delivery date which is a nice surprise. If I order on Monday sometimes they come on Wednesday or Thursday with free shipping :)
3,"Okay Products, Expired Food","I love their jeans, but I can't really say the same for their shirts. The shirts they sell seem exceptionally plain and flimsy in comparison to their prices. When I visited in store a while back, I remember that their Sour Patch candy were expired :( Overall, not a great experience in store but okay products."
5,The BEST jeans,"I love the jeans they have here. A little on the pricy side, but slap a coupon or catch them when they are having deals, and its totally worth it!! They just recently took out the buy 5 get one free jean, which sucks but I still think it's worth it. Other than the jeans and jackets from here, I don't really know, but 10/10 would recommend."
2,RETURNS RIP-OFF - BE CAREFUL,Clothes are nice quality BUT make sure you are going to keep them because unless you live in London and can return to store you are going to be hit with a hefty return fee. For some reason their returns depot address is in the Netherlands so it just cost me £8.60 to return a very small package of 1 pair of jeans and 1 tshirt!!! So it just cost me 4x the amount it would have cost to send second class within the UK. I'm outraged!
5,GREAT EXPERIENCE,"I ordered over $400 in clothes from AE.com on September 27, 2010. I recieved free shipping and handling since I had spent a lot of money. I recieved my order 5 days later and everything was absolutely perfect!"
5,Best jeans,"Although i didnt buy any clothes rather than jeans so i cant review all their clothing, but their jeans is the best out there"
1,If I could give no stars I would. Fraudulent company.,"If I could give no stars I would.They used to be a wonderful company but are now operating from Scandinavia and their conduct is nothing short of fraudulent. I placed a £100 order 31 days ago with predicted delivery time of 5-9 days. A whole month ago this order was released from customs but hasn’t moved since. ‘Customer service’ are less than useless. Will not take responsibility, refuse to refund me and simply say it is down to the shipping company. That is not my problem. I have now had to report them for fraud/theft. Such a shame but please don’t risk your hard earned money"
3,BUY CLERANCE,"The clothes here are not the quality I expected for the price. It is much more reasonable to wait for the item you wish to buy to go on sale, then purchase it. Aerie, there other brand, has much higher quality clothing. I like their bras, bathing suits, undies, shorts, and tank tops the most. The quality and price are very reasonable, but just know the item you buy will most likely go on sale within the next few weeks."
5,Easy to work with,"I always order on American Eagle. I love their clothing and it's always quick and easy. I get my orders pretty quickly and if I don't like it, I just return in stores. They have good sales and they respond quick too."
2,Lived In men's shorts,"I have several (8) pairs of AE shorts from years past. They are a cotton flex. I got a stain on the grey pair and donated them along with other items. I ordered a new pair and they changed them to ""Lived In"". The fabric is awful, and they run big in the waist and cut. I took them back to the local store and they told me that's their only shorts they make now. I'm so disappointed in AE for offering this inferior material in their shorts. I'll be buying Polo or Tommy Bahama in the future or until AE goes back to their original cotton flex shorts. I will say the sales personnel in the store was fantastic."
1,Bad company,I order some stuff from american eagle didnt recieve one thing and the also charge me shipping when it suppose to be free. Then i place my order using the discount they gave me. Then i place the order i wanted some pants they said they were out of stock then i go looking online and they are still. Then i call to order them and there regular price when there on clarence online. So this company doesnt know anything about there company or there items. They are liar and and very disrespectful to the customer and not a good company with there items the have online.
3,Came on time but quality went down hill,"I ordered a sweater and it came on time although the tracking never updated me on where the package is! Also their quality is going down hill, unfortunately will not be shopping their until they go back to their past, modern designs."
2,I used to love AE,"I used to love AE. I bought a lot of my clothes from there in my late teens and early twenties. I wish I could still enjoy their clothes, but I’ve found the quality of their items has gone done drastically over the years. They used to be my go-to for quality, well-priced clothing, but not anymore. Their prices have stayed pretty much the same and yet they are using cheaper materials (it’s hard to find anything 100% cotton) and I find their clothes do not last like they used to. Unfortunate :("
5,AE NE(X)T LEVEL SUPER SKINNY JEAN for…,"AE NE(X)T LEVEL SUPER SKINNY JEAN for 20 quid, you can't go wrong!Absolutely recommended."
1,DO NOT ORDER FROM UK!!!!,"DO NOT ORDER FROM UK!!!!! Have ordered in past with no problems..BUT now they pass your details to fedex after ordering and you get bills for import taxes, even when you have returned some items, you still have to pay taxes on full shipment.  Yes that’s even after the purchase tax which you’ve already. There is no warning from American Eagle or AE.com that this will happen. paid......YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED......bye bye American Eagle, will never order again just like others who have been affected in the same way."
4,I like jeans and T-shirts from here,"I like jeans and T-shirts from here. Design is simple and pretty. I got discounts a lot, too. When I go shopping, I frequently drop by America Eagle outfitters and enjoy looking around. I like it a lot."
1,Dreadful delivery service,"Dreadful delivery service. Use at your own risk if you are outside of mainland US. I used to buy regularly when they had a UK operation  and if the items arrive I’m pretty sure quality will be ok although I pray they fit. I chanced buying a couple of items, huge mistake.  So far it’s taken 2 weeks and has only just left the US. I know I’ll get hit with import fees too if it ever makes it to the UK. Next time I’ll just get something local or from Asia. If I can buy from Korea and China and have items delivered in approx 10 days with free or minimal postage costs why can’t the US manage it? Oh, and I’ve had the email asking me to rate the products on their site, that’s a joke."
5,I loved ordering from them because the…,"I loved ordering from them because the clothing is always well sewn and even on both sides. Their jeans also last a really long time!! Then again I don’t buy jeans with holes, so I do not mean those!! 😅"
2,American Eagle outfitters ship from US beware hidden import duty and tax,"Ordered jeans for my very tall son two years ago fitted him really well, so back in April ordered more they arrived all well and good, two weeks later get a bill from FedEX for £21. I had not realized the products were being shipped from US otherwise I would not have bought from this company. It took me quite a while to work out what the bill was for and i thought it was a scam so ignored it, now having received a bill from a debt collection company for £25.21. So please be aware you will be charged to import into the UK. I won't be using them again."
1,I have shopped here alot over the years…and now very disappointed,"I have shopped here alot over the years never had to return nothing till today ! I had a pair of jeans given to me for a gift but didn't fit, so i went to exchange them for a pair that did. The price tag was off as is common when given a gift but all other tags were still on it ..well the short of it they wouldn't give me an exchange. That in my opinion is dumb business practice,and they lost a customer forever.This was at the Bay Park Mall in Green Bay WI ."
1,Horrible customer service,Horrible customer service. They lost to return of mine and made it my problem not theirs and refused to refund the money other companies don’t treat you this bad!
1,I was a loyal customer of AEO.,"I was a loyal customer of AEO.I was surprised when I bought something, had to pay more than £60 in customs fees, and I have also to pay for the shipping to return the items that I don't fit me.Apparently, AEO closed all the stores in the UK and now this is the way they operate. What a shame! I love the brand, but I cannot recommend it anymore."
1,Bought new pair of Airflex jeans for my…,Bought new pair of Airflex jeans for my boyfriend only wore them about 4 times and already torn in crotch area. I am very disappointed with these. I have bought other pairs and the same thing but atleast those lasted longer than these Airflex jeans. I asked if i could have a pair to replace them. The online customer service person said only a discount towards new pair. How many times will i have to retrun a torn pair and keep receiving a discount and not replaced. These jeans not worth the money you pay for the quality of these jeans. This needs to be fixed. The last time i was at the store buying this pair mentioned the quality and them tearing the cashier said yes we have jeans brought in all the time torn in that area. Unsatisfied customer!!
1,No return label: returns discouraged,"I contacted customer service via chat; the rep asked how she could help and then disappeared for 20 minutes. She said she had sent a return label but it never arrived, not to my inbox nor to spam or elsewhere. She disconnected my chat without resolving the issue. I called customer service and the rep was very nice but the return labels that were said to be sent never came. I checked everywhere. I think it's AE's way of not paying for return shipping as promised, or to get people to go into the store to potentially buy more when they return. They got right on the task of taking my credit card for an exchange, but could not or would not do what was needed for me to submit a return and get my money back. Why not include a simple return form with the items when they are shipped? Why not include a preprinted label, like other companies do? Answer: they want to discourage returns, they don't want to pay for them as promised, and they want customers to have to go into the store to get their money back. It's that simple."
1,Horrible customer service,Horrible customer service within the stores. Customer service is a joke. Managers refuse to accept coupons and price match to online. Funny that some stores will price match and some will not
1,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE VIA PHONE AND…,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE VIA PHONE AND IN-STORE! MGMT MORE IMMATURE THEN OTHER EMPLOYEES STATED WAS NOT FIXING ISSUE HIS STORE WAS REASON FOR MESS UP! WILL NOT BE SHOPPING/ORDERING PRODUCTS DUE TO EXPERIENCE!!
4,Looks like pretty good deal but who…,Looks like pretty good deal but who really knows this much about this people today ? Care to share some resutls with me of their usage ? Or I am missing the whole big picture for whatever reason out there ? What do you really say. How it really will be done ?
1,Their service is unacceptableamerican Eagle sucks!,"Their service is unacceptable. Ordered in store on Black Friday something that they did. It have the right size available in store room the ordered room the money from my account and two weeks later I get an email the shipment was cancelled due to out of stock!!! Are u kidding me I purchased another shirt online and paid for that but the original shirt was not just a hold which every employee I spoke to advised me it was in fact a charge and I cannot get them to give me my money back on an order that was never fulfilled!! This is unbelievable I had to finally do a disputed with the bank and that seems it’s the only way I can maybe get my money back so I essentially paid 29.97 for nothing, they did not have the item after weeks to ship and they kept my money,I was never advised about this order at Christiana de store that they order may not be able to be fulfilled!! This customer service is horrendous and the service and customer relations is horrific. This is fraud false advertising and selling and ripping people off!! Do not but American Eagle!!!!"
1,Worst on line ordering EVER,"Worst on line ordering EVER. I ordered a Christmas present more than a month ago. Checked this morning and saw that a shipping label had been created but not shipped.  On line chatted with AEO and they immediatly canecelled the order saying it was a ""label error"" and they refunded the cost of the item but NOT the cost of shipping - which they never shipped.... I told the Chatting lady to refund all of the $$ she said that as a ""one time courtasy"" she would have the team work on refunding my extra $7.00 but in the future all ""returns"" would not include shipping costs.  OMG - they never shipped the product and they are trying to steal money from the customers. The CHAT lady then said that the order was already in the process of being cancelled - what a lie..... I screen clipped the entire CHAT - unbelivable. Who knows if I will ever get the costs of the NON shipping. I received an email zip zip of the original refund but nothing so far of the fake shipping charges. I will NEVER do business with AEO again. They shouldn't even use the word ""American""."
1,I would give zero stars if I could,I would give zero stars if I could. I just wasted a ton of money on jeans that are a scam. These jeans do not fit right and fall down constantly throughout the day with me have to constantly pull up my pants. They are not made to make your body look nice and it’s a total false livelihood. The quality is ok but I can never see myself wearing their jeans. The waist falls down and the mid rise is more like “mid low” never again and I’m returning their products. Don’t see the hype over these jeans.

5,Exceptional,"Great customer service and great sales!

4,Love the jeans,"Love the jeans! They are good for all heights, shapes, and sizes! The only thing is that they are a bit pricy but being 5’0 and small this was the first place I could get a pair of jeans that fit me right!!"
2,I love their jeans but recently I’ve…,I love their jeans but recently I’ve had to size up because their sizing is so off. Ordered an 8 online and it fit like a 2 or a 4!

1,Do Not Order Internationally!,"I've often used them to order things from the US to Korea because they claimed international shipping was free. With my current order, they switched their delivery courier to DHL, and at first I was shocked by the speed of the delivery, arriving just a couple days to their warehouse outside of Seoul. Then it all went wrong. The order literally sat in a DHL warehouse for one week while I was foolishly assuming it would be on their way, with them never trying to contact me. When I requested help from American Eagle, their customer service representatives blatantly refused to help unless the order received no change in status for one more week, but because DHL was updating the status of it not moving, they would not help. Finally, after I reached out to DHL multiple times, they claimed there was a customs mix up. After I cleared that up, they sent it on its way to me, only to then tell me there was an import fee over $500 USD. This was also yet another mix up by DHL, and after another bout of confusion they clarified that it was exactly $58 for an import fee and provided an invoice from American Eagle and DHL how they calculated it. The import duty for Korea is 13%. In their calculation, they inflate the price of my roughly $150 order and calculate massively higher tax and duties owed. Meanwhile, while reading the invoice for Freight charge sent by American Eagle, it is very curiously also $58, and DHL is demanding I conduct a bank transfer to some random bank account of theirs in order to receive my product. When I wrote American Eagle that I thought they were trying to defraud me, American Eagle literally only changed the name of their customer services representative three times in a row while sending the same pre-programmed message instructing me that they will do nothing and that I should read their shipping policy page.The issue is still unresolved, American Eagle is no longer replying to my request for assistance in making sure this isn't fraudulent, at least in the part of inflating the order price to exact a higher fee. Leaving me thinking that American Eagle and DHL are knowingly using each other so that American Eagle can claim they have free shipping (as they always had with other couriers!) and yet are really just passing the shipping costs to the consumer via DHL, after the order is paid and shipped. Everything about this seems fraudulent and deceptive, and they are about to lose a loyal customer."
