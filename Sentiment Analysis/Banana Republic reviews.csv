1,Banana Republic Factory doesn't return shipping cost,"I purchased a shirt on line from Banana Republic factory. I didn't like the fit so I returned the shirt. I was only refunded what I paid for the shirt  they did not refund the shipping cost. I asked why not and they me referred to call Banana Republic. I did and now the issue is being disputed. Whatever the outcome is, I will not shop online from that company again."
1,BEWARE OF: final sale of clothing sets that are sold separately!,"Please be careful with the final sale of clothing sets that are sold separately! I purchased both the suit jacket and pants in a very specific color (sold separately but intended as a set, due to color match) but was informed 5 days later that the jacket was not in inventory. Since both items were final sale I am now stuck with suit pants that I cannot use as they are not understanding the intention of purchasing these items together. I've been informed there is nothing they are able/willing to do which leaves me stuck and very frustrated with their product and services. I hoped they would have been more understanding to keep their customers satisfied but I suppose it is more important to stick to a company policy than keep future customers."
1,TERRIBLE DELIVERY SERVICE AND REFUND,"My first order got delayed and I got a message that will arrive days later. I needed them on time to be able to travel with them, I was suggested to buy them again paying express shipping and they assure me they will arrive on time.  Now, even that I pay 15 USD extra, the order will be also delayed 4 days.  I won't be able to take that one with me either.  I called again (3rd time) and they don't offer any solution, they say I can return the orders, but it will take 10 days to get the order back and 15 to process the order, meaning 25 days to be able to get my money back for two orders that will be delivered late due to bad management.  NEVER again.  This is very upsetting!!!"
1,Banana Republic stores are operating like Franchise store! Bad customer service,"Banana Republic stores are operating like a franchise store! On June 25, 2023 the store in Sherway Garden (Etibicoke, Ontario) has promotion of 30% additional off from sale item, while the store at Markville mall (Markham, Ontario) refuse to honor the price. Banana Republic Markville mall staff ( I went there around 3 pm pn June 25) mentioned that I should have check what is the promotion in their store prior to making the trip. They shift the responsibility to the customer. One of kind customer service."
1,I had bought an item on final sale and…,"I had bought an item on final sale and went with the recommended size from the website's True Fit feature. When the item arrived, it ended up being too small! I tried to chat with the associate online and plead my case because what's the point in buying something I can't use? Unfortunately, due to ""limitations"" they can't do anything about it and I've basically wasted my money. This is unfair business practices, and I recommend anyone to steer clear."
1,$500 shoes arrived damaged,"$500 shoes arrived damaged.  Final sale.  Contacted chat as I am hearing impaired, they say I have to call.  Advised them I cannot hear, and they said they'd have a supervisor email me within 3 hours.  27 hours later, I finally get an email, saying nothing except to call. Discriminatory- unacceptable for a large company like this."
1,Horrible customer service at banana…,Horrible customer service at banana republic factory. Sent back items and waiting on refund for a really long time. It takes up to a month for them to refund...that's a really long time. Would rather shop from retailers who process refunds in a timely manner. They also yell at you in broken English if you ask questions or don't understand what they are sayimg.
2,Not able to ship item and poor customer feedback,"The items I received were ok. After 16 days I contacted customer support to ask where the last item is. This is the answer: ""I am sorry for he inconvenience but your order is still in process due to heavy volume of orders"". Almost 3 weeks and not able to ship an item? Simply not good enough."
1,Beware of ordering online,I bought an expensive men's leather moto jacket which was the last one in my size online and nothing left in any Banana Republic stores across N. America  and the Ontario warehouse shipped a ugly looking shirt instead. I have never had this experience before and was so angry. I'm certain it wasn't an accident considering the high price and so close to Christmas. Customer service offered a refund but I wanted this unique looking jacket so bad it's annoying.
1,Bad company policy on price adjustments,"BR Factory claims on their website that it honors a one-time price adjustment within 14 days from order date.  I placed an order on Monday night and by Tuesday morning, BR Factory already had another promotion on top of the already discounted price.  When I called on Wednesday to get a price adjustment (mind you my order has not even been shipped out yet), the customer service agent told me that they could not honor the price adjustment because extra promotions do not count as price mark downs.  Essentially the company policy plays with words to make you believe they honor price adjustments but in reality they really do not.  All they will offer is to give me a future coupon (10%) so that hopefully I will spend more money with them.  NOPE, I declined the coupon and will not buy anything from BR ever again.  There are too many clothing brands to choose from for me to be willing to deal with dishonest companies."
2,Watch for the small print...,I recently made a purchase only to find out that I made the mistake (missed the print when ordering on my phone) of ordering some final sale items. When the order arrived I realized 2 of the 6 items didn't the same as the others purchased. I tried calling customer service and was told sorry there is nothing we can do. Very frustrated that they wouldn't even consider a credit. If it wasn't for the individual at least being friendly this would be a 1 star.
5,I just love the return of the old BR,"I’m surprised with all the bad reviews for Banana Republic.  I buy from them a few times a month.  Yes, the clothes are on the pricey side, but, they are made from linen, wool, silk, leather, suede—all being luxury materials.  Yes, their “final sales—no returns accepted” is a strict policy, but often prices are marked way down because of it and I either don’t shop those items—if size/fitting is in any way an issue.  They have styles that are hard to come by in other online shoppes and the return to their original styles is a serious ++.  My only qualms would be to not have so many cropped sizes on shirts and not such voluminous pants as most reviews on those items show that’s not a big fav with many of us.  Other than that, love them!"
1,It was the worst customer service…,It was the worst customer service experience I ever had. I just talked with the customer service for 1hour because I ordered my item with 2-3days shipping but the shipping confirmation shows it won’t deliver for 10 more days. They basically couldn’t help me anything as their stupid policy.  I will never use them again ever. It was just horrible experience.
1,Dawsonville North Ga premium outlet,"The short spanish guy with glasses at Dawsonville has terrible customer service. He is rude, always angry, annoyed and grumpy. Stay home if you want to be mean to customers who are spending money at your store."
2,Bad quality clothes,"The quality of the clothes is getting worse and worse. I bought two sweaters and they broke (filled with holes all over) at the first wash. Now they sell all spandex-type of clothing, which besides being harmful to health, is of the worst quality, does not last at all, and expands when washed... you can see that they are not the same original owners, but rather owners who do not care about ethics or making quality clothes. Very disappointing."
1,HORRIBLE,I finally decide to start shopping at Banana Republic and I get punished for it. I get shopping rewards for shopping and I was able to convert my rewards to Gift Card for Banana Republic. Do you know they cancelled my order due to fraud? Unbelievable. So I guess they realized their error and reissued me another card. Not thank you! I will never purchase from there again.
1,What happened to the BR Brand??,"I bought three items on March 10. After I did not get my items in the mail in 10 days because they do not offer an express shipping method, I started watching the tracking and every couple of days it was pushed back and pushed back and pushed back finally three days ago I called and asked what was going on and they said the chances of me ever receiving my product was not good so they would go ahead and refund my purchase. Pathetic at best. I will never order from banana republic factory, outlet or banana republic. Shame on you for letting your brand halo fail. I used to think of BR as quality, cool and reputable - I no longer think that way - and apparently I am not alone. Fix your operations, deliver on your promise,  train your customer service team better and lower your prices."
1,Customer Service? None.,"Purchased a brand new utility jacket that was to be mailed out to me. I was not given a receipt nor was I informed of a new exchange policy that occurred days before. When I had to exchange it, I was not allowed to because of a few days difference despite that they had record of my purchase. Called customer service and even contacted BBB. They simply did not care. Jacket is brand new with tags, unworn, it didn’t fit. Having been a loyal customer of 20 years I was greatly disappointed. I froze my credit cards and will definitely take my business elsewhere, it’s apparent they just don’t care."
1,Unethical practices,"They continuously alter “sales” after purchase to unlawfully take money from customers. I got a pair of pants from there that had a big g ink spot on them from the ink tag and they refused a refund, the tags were on and everything."
5,Have made 50+ purchases,"Have made 50+ purchases, across 3 years, delivered to 4 properties across the UK - never one issue. In fact, delivery usually comes within 2-3 days (well under the stated time frame). Returns is the easiest I’ve come across and the customer service has always been fantastic. End to end the best online shopping experience out there. Can’t fathom how someone has had a bad experience…"
1,No telephone customer service from Banana Republic,"I spent about an  hour but could not get to talk by telephone to a person who knows about rewards.  I answered the same questions by the phone robot over and over again.  I talked to Nicole, Kevin, Rosario, Mark, and Larell who put me on hold with loud rap music, then came back on the line, and put me again on hold with quieter music.  Larell gave me an answer but as he hung up, he said, ""Thank you for calling Athleta,"" so I guess he was not a BR representative and perhaps did not give me information about the BR card.I can only guess that the agents are holding a contest to find out who can give the least amount of information to ""valued customers."""
1,I’m requesting a refund for an order I…,"I’m requesting a refund for an order I did not get 1dk88byI spoke to customer service center refusing my gift card refund. Please send me the electronic gift card for the refund that is due to me as I did not receive  my order . It’s not fair you benefited from the transaction, and I did not very rude  insulant"
5,Excellent,"Excellent!  I would recommend this company to anyone.  Their clothing, shoes, and jewelry are well made.  They offer petite and taller sizes.  They offer simple tailoring services.  Their staff is attentive and professional.  The people that work here and their managers are always positive, appear to be listening, and seem genuinely concerned about anything you present to them.  Everyone seems efficient in processing any kind of transaction, such as purchases, returns, and exchanges.  No one ever seems bothered by working, even at their busiest times of year.  Always a great, stress free, shopping experience across all stores I've been to.  Thank you, BR!"
2,I’m so disappointed in Banana Republic,I’m so disappointed in Banana Republic. Their pique polos used to be amazing. Lots of colors and styles the fit was perfect. Unfortunately they decided to make 25 different polos and they are all awful except the pique ones. Too bad they only offer 5-6 boring colors. All of the other polos are loose in places tight in places and just look horrible. They had a good thing going for a long time too bad they ruined it
4,Maybe I simply do not like the name…,"Maybe I simply do not like the name itself, which good brand located in USA or something close to economy or something like that will call itself like Banana Republic which means third world country anyway for whatever reasons out there ? So it should be done. Or redone."
1,I called banana republic customer…,I called banana republic customer service to exchange size of the final sale I purchased on line and was told that it’s not possible.Terrible!!!! just wanted an exchange.How can they attract customers if the service is restrictive 😌No other option was discussed
1,BEWARE - REFUNDS,"Company do not refund unless you send several emails and proof of posting.  Even using their own return label,  checking on tracking that item delivered next day they do not refund.  In the end all you get is an apology for the delay in processing refund but no explaintion.  Waited almost a month for monies to be refunded this week. This is not a one off."
4,I've had a fantastic experience while…,"I've had a fantastic experience while shopping during sale times. The standard  delivery was super fast. The prices are decent, but sizes are all over the place and huge. Typical for American companies catering for big people. Not great if you're European. I'm a size 8 at 1.73, and xs is too big for me. The cut is not great - too big in waist and to narrow  in shoulders and not fitted on a female body (all clothes were boxy as if fitted in barrels. Perhaps these were the trends this season) The customer service was excellent."
1,Please be aware when ordering online…,"Please be aware when ordering online from this company. They don't respect their promised delivery date even if you pay extra for delivery. I ordered some items for my son's upcoming birthday and now they are saying that they won't arrive until a month after, blaming it on COVID 19! They won't offer a refund and only a small discount. Now I have to spend money on another gift as what I ordered will be of no use. Very poor customer service, won't buy from this company again."
1,Sizing of Products Is a Hot Mess!,"Sizing of men’s products is a mess! I used to buy online quite a bit, but the past couple years it has become inconsistent and confusing! I can’t even figure out my size in the stores anymore. The fits have names associated with them that hurt not help you figure out what you should try on, and often means you have to try the same shirt or pant in too many sizes. Also, they have made all the sizes smaller, even an XXL shirt is smaller than an XL in most brands. Quality has become super inconsistent too, becoming Old Navy with higher prices."
1,missized items,Horrible customer service.  Bought 2 items final sale by accident.  sizing was wrong on them and cannot return them.  Company would not do anything for me.  I will never shop here again.
1,Hopeless services. BR had just the jacket I…,I decided that BR had just the jacket I want this Autumn. Never shopped there before so pleased to be offered 15% off as sign up bonus.Tried twice to use the code from 2 different email address. Neither worked.Emails took hours to come through so I had to keep checking & then code didn’t work.I took photos & emailed Uk customer service address on website. Email returned as address invalid.Hopeless. Maybe I’m glad I didn’t buy anything as it looks as if mail order service is useless.I wouldn’t trust them at all.
1,Wrong package from Banana Republic Factory,"I ordered 6 items in Banana Republic Factory online before black Friday and I received the whole package wrong. I received somebody else’s clothes. This the second time that happened me. I won’t be able to acquire the products in the size and price I wanted, and I need to return the incorrect stuff to the store. Lost of time and money."
1,Shocking what this company is allowed…,"Shocking what this company is allowed to get away with. After luring new customers into signing up for their mailing list with promises of discount codes, these codes never materialise and even though your inbox is then cluttered with their recommendations, the staff deny your email address is even registered. No wonder they closed every UK store as they are rapidly going down the toilet."
2,I would give one star,"I would give one star, but I often like their styles.  It's the return policy which is super stringent and unreasonable especially for Christmas purchases.  I am stuck with brand new items that did not fit as gifts and I tried to return them only 3 weeks after Christmas, but it was after their cut-off and they would not budge.  Not a company I want to do business with.  They need to do better."
1,I'm not impressed,"I'm not impressed. Ordered 3 items and the fabric was falsely advertised. I contacted them for a free return, the women said she'll put a credit to my account to accommodate the free return. The next day I went online to start my return and it came up as ""page cannot be displayed"". I telephoned and was left on hold for over an hour!  Poor customer service."
5,Excellent experience so far :),"I bought 1 sweater & coat online an di far it was one of the best experience in my shopping online. The coat didn't fit well, I already have the return label included in my packing so I did not spend time dealing with it. I sent the coat with my pre-paid label and in 1 week my money was in my banck account. The quality of my sweater was good. Excellent experience so far :)"
1,Returned Two Items,"I returned two items using their pre-paid shipping label through Canada Post in early May. The tracking number shows that the package had been returned to Banana Republic in Mississauga, ON. I have yet to receive my refund."
1,If I could give O stars I would for…,If I could give O stars I would for customer service and customer deception. They list reduced products on their website that are no longer available. This sale ethics is not acceptable. Like many other customer my experience with this company has been very bad.
1,Received the jeans I ordered with the…,"Received the jeans I ordered with the security tag still on them. Return confirmation received for 10/5.  It is 12/22 and I have still not received my refund. Called and was told they need to open up an ""investigation"" although the guy stated to he me showed the return received.  Due to the issue with the order and the terrible customer service, I would not recommend ordering from this retailer."
3,ship item to me pair shoes box falling…,"ship item to me pair shoes box falling apart so they sent a second pair out which did not fit so made a return in the store directly and it never credit my BR card had to jump through hoops to get this resolved. I am so glad I kept my receipt or i would have been sool . They at least tried to make it right by sending me a $10 promo card. The quality of merchandise been going down hill fast.I remember 10 -15 years ago they had awesome quality stuff. Today everything is cheaply made, slim/skinny fit which only a 15 year old vegetarian could fit into and way over priced."
1,I used to shop here all the time but…,I used to shop here all the time but now it seems like they’re more concerned about pushing their political agenda than losing business by alienating and driving away half their customer base.  I look forward to the day they go out of business because they’re so self righteous they can’t stay out of politics. Aligning themselves with Rock the Vote which is a left-wing organization and having pro-RBG and “Vote for a Better Republic” fashion statements are just a couple of examples.  I remember a day when businesses tried to respect their clientele by staying politically neutral  but now it seems like self-righteous leftists that take control of businesses can’t just shut up. Peace Banana Republic.  Hope you wise up or go belly up. ✌️
4,"Yes, something with their name","Yes, something with their name which may give to some certain audience something like bad perception of overall thing out there but I do not see how it will be happening lately. So can we do something better with that or not ? How else you can check that much ?"
1,they don't follow instructions and send you stuff you tell them not to!!!!,"ordered these on a Saturday: website malfunctioned and did not take any discounts to which I had EARNED! Called company 2 minutes later to cancel order. Rep told me she cancelled it and I still got charged FULL PRICE AND STUFF was sent!!!!! I had to drive over an hour to return the stuff and get my discount. When I've tried to return free by mail, I have spent hours on the phone chasing my money back even months after stuff arrived at warhouse!!!! Don't order from this incompetant business online!!!!!"
2,Awful Customer Service Experience!,"I have been a regular and loyal Banana Republic customer for many years. I ordered a few dresses for upcoming holiday parties and paid for express shipping. When I received an email that the package would arrive after my holiday party, I called the mail carrier who informed me that Banana Republic had shipped them via the slowest shipment possible instead of the express shipping I paid for. I called Banana Republic and they refunded me my expedited shipping costs, but were unable/unwilling to do anything to correct the situation. I just received an email from UPS that the package will be delayed again, and I will have no need for the items at that point. Absolutely awful experience. Will not be shopping here again."
1,They have lost my package twice,"They have lost my package twice. they only answer after the 10 bussiness days have passed for any question even the ones that a re about the tracking of their products, there's no tracking on your package (they give you a tracking number but it doesn't work). I understand why the company is almost broke. Not even Kanye West can save this crappy company from being the worst in every sense. Maybe the american one is better, but the one from europe is terrible. Terrible customer support, terrible shipping. NEVER BUYING AGAIN WITH THEM and really, if you don't want to have a bad experience, and get frustrated, don't buy at Banana Republic europe."
1,As a person who doesn’t like fancy…,As a person who doesn’t like fancy store this one was the worst! Banana republic @ assembly row and it was the worst place 2 be absolutely ruined me as a person! Nd my point of view of how there’s no longer good people in the world! Unless they’re getting wat they want in the process of it! 🤦🏾‍♀️.
1,Beware of strict return policy,Beware of strict return policy. I ordered a Christmas gift online and even with a receipt I can’t return it after 30 days. I need one size larger and the return policy will not allow. Huge mistake ordering from this company.
5,Prompt and efficient service,"This actually relates to bananarepublic.co.uk, but I think they are the one operation in Europe? Had an issue with products through no fault of theirs, emailed customer service and got a response the next day with a confirmation that I would be refunded for items.  No complaints here!"
5,Factory site is fantastic,"I frequently shop online with them at the factory site and love it. They often have great deals. Yesterday (for the first time) I received an incorrect order and CS had it fixed in a few minutes (with no long ""please hold"") AND they're sending me the correct item. Glad they have small sizes. The clothes run about one size large, but knowing that it's still consistent and if I order a 00 or 0 pair of pants, or a PS sweater, they will fit the same each time, no surprises. I'm a teacher and the clothes look nice but are still very comfortable and easily cleaned. Super nice CS people, too."
1,Horrible customer service,"Horrible customer service, entered the right address on the shipping but my ordered was shipped on a different address, Dont know how this happened as I have the same shipping and billing address. I even tried calling them to cancel instead they shipped it right away. I told them I am interested with the order and will just reorder again but they said they cant do anything about it. Why do they have a customer service line if they cant do anything to help the customer? What if my order was received in the wrong address?"
4,Icon Membership Customer Journey Should be Improved,"I've been using BR credit card and shopping at BR and its family brands for years. Their app is awesome. In-store shopping and return is very convenient while the quality of their products varies, and sometimes garment to garment (not good quality control). My complaint is mainly about redeeming rewards of the Icon membership. One of the benefits of the Icon membership is that you can define your own sale day, which is 15% off of your entire purchase. However, I could not find it from my app, and the agent from the BR customer service told me I had to call a certain number to get the benefit, which was super inconvenient and time consuming. The process can definitely designed better."
1,Bananan Republic Cheats People,"Refused to refund purchase that was wrong size.  Had purchased a larger size but then the company refused to refund on the first purchase.  Essentially, Banana Republic plays shell games with customers."
1,Overpriced garbage most of the time,Overpriced garbage most of the time.  No point buying anything in between sales. Quality is so unreliable as well.
1,"Bought one item for $210 from BR. Instead, it charged me $1,240.83 for everything sitting in my Athleta shopping cart","On 4/23/23, I ordered one (1) dress from the Banana Republic website. The total after taxes was $210 and change. I agreed to purchase the ONE (1) dress for $210 and change and I went through the entire payment process and received a confirmation for that amount. Next thing I know, I have a confirmation for ELEVEN (11) items for $1,240.83. Instead of ordering the one BR dress, the checkout process somehow glitched and the dress was never ordered (even though I got a confirmation). Instead, it ordered and charged everything that happened to be sitting in my Athleta shopping cart. What is going on, BR? That was a fraudulent charge that I never approved!I called customer service and waited on hold for a good bit. The lady was courteous, but told me things like, ""Well, maybe in the future don't leave things in your carts because from our end it's tied together"" or something like that. I don't care if it is tied together on their end -- from the user experience side of things they are different URLs, different shopping carts, and different checkout processes. She was able to cancel the fraudulent transaction and was working on getting the dress I ordered to me when the call was, of course, disconnected. Shameful, Banana Republic et al. Do better! This is unacceptable!"
1,Horrible customer service!!!!,Horrible customer service!!!!! Got a gift card as a birthday present and so far I’ve had to call this customer service line 4 times and every time someone passes the blame! One time I Spoke to Kelly in the “research” department who said she put my order in and it’s still not here- no confirmation number or email!!! Called today and Michelle passed the call to “escalation supervisor” Eric who was sorry for what I was experiencing but could not do anything for me. Then why am I talking to you? Why transfer the call Michelle?! He told me to call back to speak with the research department because they’re not open right now. IT’S A GIFT CARD FROM YOUR STORE?! I’m beyond pissed and frustrated with this process! Will never purchase anything from this place ever again!!!! And I’m leaving this review everywhere I can!!!
2,It took too long to get my money back,"It took too long to get my money back, i had to email them several times with proof of my refund AND my order in the first place, and even though i gave them the order number, they ""couldn't find"" my order. At last, several months after, i got my money.Way too much worrying, not worth it."
1,DO NOT EVER THINK IN BUY,"MAN! THEY STOLE ME $200! I wrote emails, no replies, I can't call bcoz im out of the country, they say they have chat in the website but they don't. unreacheable. No one replys the dm on instagram, my order 1CTCMFN which i received a refund of only $313 and it should be $523 and they dont give a puck.AWFULL CLOTHES QUALITY, thats why i returned!!!"
1,When I am online shopping the photos…,When I am online shopping the photos look beautiful but once I order the product and it reaches my home the quality is not there at all I feel as if I am paying for the beautiful glossy pics and that's it. I ordered plaid shacket it was not lined it was itchy and pricey. Ordered a shirt it was see through however in the pics it was not. It sometimes feels like bait and switch.ordered purse as well
5,I would like to thanks Makenzie today…,"I would like to thanks Makenzie today at Tanger location about his great customer service ,and how he was patient and helpful going all over the prices on each pieces we buy and tell us the discount , thanks again for your great sevice"
1,No Customer Service,"I recently order two dress shirts as birthday gifts for my nephew.  As soon as I received the confirmation, I realized they were sending the shirts to my address instead of his in Saratoga Springs, NY.  I called immediately and they told me they could not change the address....it was too late and would not let me cancel the order so I could reorder using the right address.  How could it be too late when I called a few minutes after I hit the place order button?  I talked to a manager as well who could care less that it was going to the wrong address.  I've used BR for years, but no more!  They have the worst customer service I've ever seen.  Buyers beware!!!"
1,Poor aftersales - unable to use Gift cards,"Part of the same company as GAP Clothing...  just a different brand name.  Another supposedly large clothing company who cannot provide an acceptable level of customer service, they just waffle around the subject with no answers and no resolution. Banana Republic advertise that you can use all4one gift cards but I was unable to do so and was given no comprehendible explanation."
1,Placed an order and realized it was not…,Placed an order and realized it was not the fit i wanted. I tried to cancel and they refuse to cancel my order after 1 hour of placing. Definitely wont buy from them again. Spoke to Shannon Johnson and rudely laughed and when i asked to speak to someone else she hung up.
5,"Great quality. Good accuracy on sized, good price","Great quality, I'm very happy for the accurate of the sizes, I'm petite size, -slightly/about 20 pounds overweight-, and its hard to find clothes that make me look good, but this store have them all.  I been buying online from Banana Republic and I have no one single complain and no one time any returns. Price is right. Hard to find this dates. Very Happy"
1,Absolutely horrible customer service,Absolutely horrible customer service. I placed an order on May 27 2020 and have yet to receive it. It is now June 17th. My visa was charged 2 weeks ago and the items have been paid for. I have sent several emails to customer service and have not received one response.
1,NEVER BUYING FROM BANANA REPUBLIC EVER…,"NEVER BUYING FROM BANANA REPUBLIC EVER A. G. A. I. N!!! I paid an expedited shipping to get to me the day before my trip abroad- they missed the guaranteed date which didn’t get to use it with me so I bought Amazon instead. Upon going back to the country, I returned all the things in the original shipment box”unopened” but little did I know that was only the first shipment box of my whole order. Second box was in the mailroom and didn’t realize it so I was ready to return. I caught COVID and couldn’t leave the house until I tested negative so I could not physically go in to UPS nor the store to do so… I got 5 days late of their 30 day window(this is from the date on when items where shipped from their warehouse and not when the shipment arrived at your doorstep) I couldn’t get a one time courtesy to be able to return unused, and the unopened shipper box as their policy is NO EXCEPTION EVEN IF YOURE IN THE BRINK OF DEATH! Dramatic? Yes, but this company shows NO COMPASSION WHATSOEVER! $1,163 down the drain as the items ordered doesn’t fit me right since keeping it seems to be the only option. So taking my business elsewhere and will deter my circle to support any of their brands- Athleta, old navy, gap and banana republic 101%"
5,Absolutely love their customer service…,Absolutely love their customer service and the brand! They always are super quick with shipments and I never had an issue with my order. I place an order or two every month. Love it!
1,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE VIA PHONE AND…,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE VIA PHONE AND IN-STORE! MGMT MORE IMMATURE THEN OTHER EMPLOYEES STATED WAS NOT FIXING ISSUE HIS STORE WAS REASON FOR MESS UP! WILL NOT BE SHOPPING/ORDERING PRODUCTS DUE TO EXPERIENCE!!
1,What a crap company,What a crap company. They sent me the wrong item and then had to email me a return label for more stress. This company is Absolute rubbish. You can’t even return in store and they made the mistake
2,Useless,"I ordered some shoes they arrived really quickly but, they were very small. So I tried to call banana republic to change them, the phone numbers on their website were wrong. So I mailed them, it takes over 2 days for them to answer a mail!   Now I've retuned the shoes, they've had them for over 10 days, but tell me refunds take up to 30 days.... Won't be using again, a waste of time and energy."
5,GREAT,"Their specials are great,I have a few dresses from them and I am enjoying them so much,sizes are perfect,discounts so good,thank you!!!!"
1,This is my second review for this…,"This is my second review for this company. My first one was about the customer service, or I should say, about the absence of it and this one, is about their product quality. I have purchased a pair of black dress pants from BR early this year and started wearing them to work just now. Guess what, they have stained everything they touched black. My skin, my office chair, my white silk top and my purse. Great! A pair of cheap, $70 pants ruined everything they touched. BR's quality product went dramatically down in the last 10 years and this was the last straw. I will never purchase from them again. There are other clothing companies out there that have respect for the customers and stand behind the quality of what they sell. Like Club Monaco for instance. I'd rather pay more and buy less and save myself the frustration by dealing with BR's garbage clothing."
1,As fast as you take you should give back,Look I know there is virus out there but you seemed to take my money the same day I ordered while the virus was around......it's been over 1 month now and your telling me be patient.! it's ok to take money but not  to give back just as fast ! Return refund excuse ....(pandemic..)yes pandemic is still here ..I want my refund...
1,Perfume,"1st , I love banana republic and have been using the perfume W for 30+ years. Now the perfume smells like alcohol, no scent at all not even a hint of the old product. Sad to say bye."
1,"Ordered on May 24th, it's now July 20th","Ordered on May 24th, called them June 23rd, lady said it's in the back of a truck, but will make it to me. They just don't know when. I called them again July 19th, another lady offered to do a 1-day shipping. She cancelled my first order and did a re-ship. I was ecstatic! I woke up today, July 20th, to find an e-mail saying the item is sold out and that my order has been cancelled. Called them and another lady told me I'll get my original order and that it's not cancelled, there's just no ETA. So my original shipment is still waiting in the back of a truck, possibly cancelled with how unreliable the info relayed has been, and the 1-day shipping was just for show. I've been extremely patient for 2 months, politely checking in and all on the status of a pair of earrings that I've been eyeing for months before buying the moment they went on a good sale. I don't mind waiting, but the lack of information and updates on my item ordered 2 months ago, and a useless re-ship, has me questioning the quality of customer service they provide. I know we're in a pandemic, but even items coming from the other side of the world make it to me within a month and customer service always KNOWS where my items are. The lack of organization is appalling. I'd understand if they were shipping with Canada Post, but they're shipping with UPS. Baffling and disappointing."
1,They returned my return!??  What?,"First and LAST transaction I will have with BR.  Purchased a pair of sunglasses.  Upon receiving it was clear that I would have been better off with better quality for half the price from W-Mart or anywhere else, apparently.  The hinges on the frames were very cheaply constructed and the lenses were loose inside the frames.  Upon processing a return I was quite disappointed to find that I would not be reimbursed for the shipping amount.  Should of gone with an A Prime purchase like usual I guess.  Then the true madness of BR hit me.  15 days after returning the product, I received it back to my mailbox...in a packaging mess of ripped plastic and tape and labels all over.  Upon contacting BR to find out why it was shipped back to me, they said that receiving staff found there to be no issue with the product so it was returned to me.  What???  They will not accept my return of a brand new unused product, minus the shipping cost argument???  What is this place?  Customer service (Christina B) told me to file a dispute through my bank transaction, so that is what I will do.  Not for the money but for the principle of the matter.  BBB will also receive another report.  This is ridiculous.  I fully expect BR to be out of business soon...and they have clearly done it to themselves."
5,My beautiful sweater just arrived and…,My beautiful sweater just arrived and it's so chunky and soft and beautiful!!!! Got it on sale. I love love love it. Thank you banana republic!!!!
1,SCAM ALERT,"SCAM ALERT: DO NOT GET THIER CREDIT CARD! It may be a scam. I have been trying to pay it every which way for a couple months and its impossible. They call everyday with an automated message, but when you try to get through it it disconnects, sounds like they sold my debt to some other firm while I am trying to pay. So dont think your info is safe when they have it. I didnt get the card so I cant make an account, they claim my Zip is wrong. I cant get a real person. Im sure the interest rate is terrible and now its hurting my credit. All for a pair of pants. Buyer beware, might not be worth the 20% off or whatever the sign up deal is in not worth it. I would have gladly paid the 40 bucks or whatever it was."

3,My grand daughter wanted to shop here…,My grand daughter wanted to shop here so bad but everything is so expensive.i finally broke and got her some items. Some did not fit even though they were her exact size
1,Awful customer service,"Awful customer service via online chat.  I was placing an order because I had a gift certificate - during time of checkout their checkout process didn't have a place to input the gift certificate so I thought I needed to proceed with entering payment info in order to proceed to the next page of the checkout process whereas I thought there'd be a spot to place the gift card, however the order proceeded to finalize and charged my credit card.  Upon immediately speaking & explaining the situation to an online chat rep, I was informed that I didn't select the correct checkout procedure.  I asked to have the order cancelled so I could proceed checking out the correct way to which I was informed that they put a request in to cancel but couldn't guarantee it would be cancelled.  In the end, they processed the order and shipped it & charged my credit card.  There's something terribly wrong with their procedures as I had asked for cancellation within 5 minutes of placing the order.  I will never purchase from this company again - awful customer service."
1,Useless Site,After six attempts gave up trying to place an order.Amazed that for once they had my size in stock. ....then they would not process my order!Don’t waste your time.
5,Amazing place to work,I loved working at he store in regent street as evryone was so friendly and my manger Richard was the best.
1,Buyer beware,"Buyer beware, Banana Republic may not refund you for your returns as they believe it is a courtesy to do so. They are also the rudest company I have ever dealt with and refuse to apologize for their shortcomings. Overall Banana Republic offered me the worst customer service that I have ever experienced and they seem to think it’s not important.I had to return two shirts as they were too big. I went into the returns section on their website and they sent me the shipping label. I returned the product using the shipping label they provided and I have tracking of the product saying it was delivered. I emailed the company after a couple of weeks querying the delay with the refund. Approx one month later Banana Republic emailed me to say that they could not see the details of where it was delivered in the UK but out of courtesy they would issue a refund. Out of courtesy! I explained that this was not an issue of courtesy and that I had followed their returns directions and used the shipping label that they provided so if there were any issues with the delievery then that was their problem with the shipping company. It is not a courtesy get your money back when you follow the companies own procedure! I would liken Banana Republic to scam artists based on this.They also do not forward complaints to senior managers despite several requests to do so; or else the senior managers are just as clueless and horrible.If I were you I would avoid Banana Republic altogether they are obviously unprofessional, rude and don’t understand their obligations or their responsibilities. More importantly they may not refund you for your returns!Please be careful of Banana Republic, the dodgiest purchasing experience I have ever had to endure."
1,Terrible refund processing,"Terrible refund processing, I will never ever buy smth from them."
1,I purchased  this dress twice  by accident and he said too bad,"I purchased this dress in small but after a week of no email confirming i would get it ... i forgot and i assumed it was sold out (my bad) the following week i saw that they still had this open back fushia dress soi ordered it ... after two weeks i get both dresses the same day i didn't get a curtisy call did i want the same dress but i did get a too bad for you it was a innocent mistake i order always from online it's a treat i call customer service the employee  makes me say the whole story after i said i know no returns and says he will help me 100% to then tell me what i already told him final sale on sale items and nothing he can doif this was aritzia and other genuine customer service stores they would go out of there way to make a executive decision  or try to make me happy ... i have the same color same dress and he said sorry donate it it's one thing if i was trying to return or exchange something that i only have one of but it's the exact same color dress and he said "" oh yes u bought it twice "" he wouldn't connect me to his supervisor and said the distrubution center won't care im very disappointed ... a policy is a policy but sometimes we need to make executive decisions to common sense 150 down the drain during a time like this ....   i don't blame the guy who wasted my time i blame the company whohas no way to contact when customer service is a waste of time im a very generous person but i have a very distasteful feeling in my mouth it was a innocent mistake but the company doesn't care or there would be a way to contact them the gentleman said to write this and i was like are u sure ... i don't want to ... i all wanted was so compassion for ordering the same dress twice and a exchange how dare he tell me todonate it ... i donate and am very giving i asked for his supervisor and i was told u will get the same answer i honestly made a mistake and he said the distributor will not take it back and i was like so basically due to a over look im stuck with it and he said donate it ... okay ... thanku for ur time"

1,Shame on Banana Republic Corporate!,"It appears that Banana Republic Corporate is falling short of ensuring consumers are recipients of quality, knowledgable, respectful, and supportive customer service.  I returned an item within 24 hours of my receipt using the company's prepaid shipping label.  Unfortunately, the shipment was apparently lost in transit.  Although I provided Banana Republic with a copy of my UPS receipt validating my (prompt) return of the item, the company refused to issue a refund until the lost shipment was located and / or a claim was submitted.  I informed both the representative and supervisor that this issue was between Banana Republic and their 'contracted shipper' and does not involve the customer.  Further, I asserted that their refusal to issue my refund due to a problem with their shipper is a violation of my consumer rights.  However, PayPal issued my rightful and long overdue refund immediately following the initiation of a dispute claim.  Sadly, Banana Republic's continuing pattern of numerous negative online reviews is indicative of their failure to micromanage staff training, their level of knowledge specific to policies and consumer rights, and personable customer service skills.  Shame on Banana Republic Corporate for their role in allowing customers to be victim to such substandard customer service!"
